Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\n",

To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of 85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90 of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing. Cell classes in human retina To generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human retina, we obtained eight retinas from seven genetically unrelated human donors with no clinical history of ocular disease Table S1. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq to generate a cell atlas of the adult human retina.\\nDataset: Cell Type: Mueller cell, Tissue: fovea centralis, Gene Expression: MALAT1 APOE CLU GLUL GAPDH

To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of 85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90 of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing.

Emerging computational methods applied to high-dimensional single-cell data allow integration of results between samples and species and illuminate the diversity and underlying developmental and architectural organization of cell populations. Here, we illustrate these methods in the analysis of mouse lymph node LN lymphatic endothelial cells LEC at single-cell resolution. Clustering identifies five well-delineated subsets, including two medullary sinus subsets not previously recognized as distinct. Nearest neighbor alignments in trajectory space position the major subsets in a sequence that recapitulates the known features and suggests novel features of LN lymphatic organization, providing a transcriptional map of the lymphatic endothelial niches and of the transitions between them. Differences in gene expression reveal specialized programs for 1 subcapsular ceiling endothelial interactions with the capsule connective tissue and cells; 2 subcapsular floor regulation of lymph borne cell entry into the LN parenchyma and antigen presentation; and 3 pathogen interactions and 4 LN remodeling in distinct medullary subsets. LEC of the subcapsular sinus floor and medulla, which represent major sites of cell entry and exit from the LN parenchyma respectively, respond robustly to oxazolone inflammation challenge with enriched signaling pathways that converge on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Integration of mouse and human single-cell profiles reveals a conserved cross-species pattern of lymphatic vascular niches and gene expression, as well as specialized human subsets and genes unique to each species. The examples provided demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis in elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, vascular organization, and endothelial cell responses. We discuss the findings from the perspective of LEC functions in relation to niche formations in the unique stromal and highly immunological environment of the LN.

Introduction Lymph nodes LNs serve as hubs for the interaction and communication between tissue-derived and blood-derived immune cells 1. Integrated along the large collecting lymphatic vessels, they are vital sensors of tissue damage, constantly sampling the incoming lymph 2. The LN comprises a complex network of lymphatic sinuses surrounding a dense parenchyma, which mainly consists of immune cells but also specialized blood vessels and a network of mesenchymal cells 13. Segregated B cell cortex and T cell paracortex areas characterize the LN architecture 4. It is well-established that the LN stromal cells play a central role in maintaining both this structure and the immunological functions of the LN, providing chemotactic cues, cytokines, and a structural reticular framework that guide immune cell positioning, migration, survival, and activation reviews: 3, 5. Single-cell sequencing has enabled delineation of nine distinct clusters of murine LN mesenchymal cell phenotypes 6 underlining the complexity needed to maintain the LN structure and coordinate immunity. The lymphatic vasculature is the first structural component of the LN encountered by incoming lymph-borne molecules or cells. Recent studies have revealed an intriguing regional specialization and cellular heterogeneity that characterize the LN lymphatic endothelium and differentiate the LN lymphatic endothelial cells LECs from LECs in peripheral lymphatic vessels 712. Subset-specific markers with functional implications include the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR4 also known as CCRL1, specifically expressed by the LEC layer that forms the ceiling cLECs of the subcapsular sinus SCS 9, where lymph enters from the afferent collecting vessels. ACKR4 is a scavenger receptor for the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 13 and controls entry of tissue-derived dendritic cells DCs into the LN through controlling the formation of CCL21 chemokine gradients across the SCS 9. Leukocyte entry occurs primarily through the SCS floor LECs fLECs, which in mouse express the mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 MAdCAM-1 7, 14 among other adhesion and attractant molecules that can control leukocyte transmigration 7, 15. The SCS also functions as a physical barrier and gateway, enabling size-restricted access of antigens to the LN parenchyma 16: the glycoprotein plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein PLVAP, together with cLEC-expressed caveolin 1 CAV1 10, form sieve-like diaphragms in the transendothelial channels that bridge the SCS to the conduit system and descend from the SCS floor 10. This structural barrier is complemented by a dense network of macrophages closely associated with SCS, providing essential innate immune functions and a filtering system for pathogens 17. The SCS and medullary sinus macrophage niches in the LN were recently shown to be dependent on LEC-expressed CSF-1 colony stimulating factor 1 18 and receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B RANKRANKL signaling between the LN LECs and SCS lining mesenchymal cells 19. LN LECs can also directly influence adaptive immune responses, either through presentation of tissue antigens, which contributes to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance 2022, or by serving as reservoirs for antigens 23. LN LECs express the immune-checkpoint ligand programmed death-ligand 1 PD-L1 also known as CD274 7, 24, an inhibitor of T cell activation, and lack expression of co-stimulatory genes 24, which may explain their role in tolerance. PD-L1 is expressed selectively in the floor of the SCS fLECs, cortical sinuses, and parts of the medulla 7, 24. Genes that influence the communication between LECs and their surroundings could contribute to endothelial regulation as well, and interestingly, PD-L1 expression moderates proliferation and enhances survival of LN LECs in inflammation 25. The diverse and site-specific specialization of the LN lymphatic endothelium is at least partly dependent on crosstalk with immune cells, with contributions from B cells, T cells 7, 26, and mesenchymal stromal cells 19. Hence, the LNs provide both a unique model system to explore endothelial cell interactions with their surroundings and a model for exploring endothelial diversity and phenotypic plasticity. Our recent single-cell analysis of the human LN LECs revealed the complexity and specialization of the LN lymphatic endothelium in man 27. A detailed profiling of the mouse lymphatic endothelium and comparison of human and mouse LN lymphatic endothelium is still missing. Here we provide single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the mouse LN lymphatic vasculature. We show that computational alignments relationships revealed by nearest neighbor trajectory inference recapitulate key aspects of the tissue architecture and predict physical relationships between LN LECs in the tissue, illustrating the power of single-cell analysis for understanding the organization of the vascular endothelium. Cross-species analyses further allowed us to define conserved and divergent LEC phenotypes and lymphatic vascular niches. Notably, the analysis delineates two specialized subsets of medullary sinus LECs, present in both mouse and human that are distinct in gene expression and location in the LN. Using the mouse LN response to cutaneous oxazolone as a model, we show that sites of immune cell entry and exit from the LN, fLECs, and paracortical sinuses, respectively, respond rapidly to inflammation, whereas structurally important cLECs are less affected. Together, the results demonstrate the power of bioinformatic tools for elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, physical relationships, and cellular responses in complex vascular beds, and provide a basis for future detailed analysis of human and mouse LN LEC responses in disease. Results and Discussion Single-Cell Trajectories Model Tissue Architecture and Physical Relationships Between LN LECs To assess the heterogeneity of the lymphatic vasculature and the relationships between lymphatic vascular niches, we analyzed lin podoplanin PDPN CD31 cells from mouse peripheral LNs i.e., axillary, brachial and inguinal by single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics system. An independent set of LN LECs was sorted as single cells and subjected to SMART-seq2 analysis 28. Prospero homeobox protein 1 Prox1 was used as a pan-LEC marker in the analysis 29. Blood endothelial cells Flt1Ly6c1, immune cells Cd45, and pericytes Pdgfra or Pdgfrb were identified by marker gene expression and excluded from further analysis. We used a combination of unsupervised clustering and graph-based methods to determine LEC subsets; Methods.. Mouse LN LEC subsets revealed by 10x and SMART-seq2. A Experimental workflow. Mouse peripheral LNs were isolated and dissociated into single-cell suspensions. Hematopoietic cells were MACS-depleted, and EC linCD31 were FACS-sorted for single-cell sequencing using the droplet-based 10x Genomics system or the SMART-seq2 workflow figure created with BioRender.com.

C tSpace analysis of single-cell trajectories depicting nearest neighbor alignments of LECs. D Expression of LEC subset defining genes in C57BL6 mouse 10x. Dots indicate mean log-normalized transcript count. In addition to gene profile-based dimensionality reduction with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding tSNE and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP see below, we used a trajectory analysis algorithm, tSpace 30, to define high dimensional nearest neighbor alignments that emphasize the continuum of cell phenotypes and reveal transitions between related cells. In developing cell systems, trajectory inference methods can model developmental sequence pseudotime 30. In the resting adult vascular endothelium, they facilitate computational modeling of vessel architecture 27, 31. Subsets and alignments were shared in mice with different genetic backgrounds C57BL6 and BALBc Figure S1A. Cells from both male and female mice were represented in the dataset and comprised similar phenotypes Figure S1B. However, the study was not designed or powered to examine strain- or sex-dependent differences in LN LECs, and these remain to be further explored. Our analyses identified major clusters representing LN cLECs and fLECs based on the expression of known SCS ceiling marker Ackr4 9 as well as SCS floor markers Madcam1 7, 14 and the chemokine Ccl20 15, 27 and Figure S1C. Candidate valve-related LECs display high expression of known lymphatic valve markers, including the transcription factor Forkhead box protein C2 Foxc2 32 and Figure S1C. A minor cluster, most apparent in tSpace projections and associated with valve, expressed higher levels of peripheral lymphatic vessels markers including lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 Lyve1 and the chemokine Ccl21, together with lower expression of Foxc2 compared to the candidate valve LECs. This population likely represents collector or pre-collector LECs 2, 32. These subsets were poorly represented in our data and we discuss them in the context of the architecture of LN LECs, but exclude them from detailed differential gene expression analyses below. Unsupervised clusters separate Lyve1 high candidate medullary sinus LEC into two subsets, referred to here as Ptx3-LECs Ptx3 and Marco-LECs Marco and Figure S1C. Alignment of LECs in tSpace visualization recapitulates known connections within the complex lymphatic endothelial network in LN and reveals previously unappreciated relationships as well as intermediate, putative transitional phenotypes. In addition to the subsets identified by clustering, we highlight two transitional populations here, for discussion below. Transition zone tzLECs comprise a link between fLECs and Marco-LECs in tSpace. Additionally, a minor bridge population B aligns along a direct path between fLECs and cLECs in tSpace projection. As emphasized by numbering of subsets in and illustrated schematically in, trajectories starting from candidate collecting LECs 1 lead prominently to valve 2 and to SCS ceiling LEC 3, consistent with their known physical connections. cLECs branch to fLECs through the bridging population B but also transition prominently to Ptx3-LECs 4, Ptx3-LECs to Marco-LECs 5, and Marco-LECs via tzLECs 6 to fLEC 7 along a phenotypic sequence or path that is well-represented in all LEC datasets here. In situ Localization of LN LEC Subsets To define LEC subsets and their niches in situ, we carried out immunofluorescence staining using antibodies to subset differentiating markers predicted from gene expression in inguinal LNs of Prox1-GFP reporter mice 33, where all LECs express the fluorescent reporter GFP. scRNA-seq predicts that LYVE-1 is absent in cLECs and low in fLECs, but is highly expressed in Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs. Staining for LYVE-1 highlights the cortical, paracortical, and entire medullary region of mouse inguinal LN Figures 2A,B. Expression of Cd274, which encodes the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1, distinguishes fLECs, Marco-LECs, and tzLECs Cd274high from Ptx3-LECs Cd274low and Figure S1C. Co-immunostaining of PD-L1 and LYVE-1 shows that PD-L1 expression defines the fLECs and discrete regions of LYVE-1high medullary sinus LECs that are distant from the hilus. Expression of Marco, which encodes the scavenger receptor Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure MARCO, is highly selective for Marco-LECs: MARCO is a known medullary sinus marker in human LN 27, 34. We show that MARCO expression pattern in the mouse LN medulla selectively overlaps with that of PD-L1. Conversely, in situ hybridization for Ptx3 RNAscope specifically outlines the central medullary sinuses with particularly strong signals in the paracortical cords Figures 3A,B, overlapping with the area of LYVE-1high PD-L1 MARCO cords outlined by protein staining. Co-staining of MARCO and the B-cell marker B220 shows that MARCOhigh regions start from the cortical areas defined based on presence of B-cell follicles and extend into the peri-follicular medulla of both inguinal and popliteal LNs Figure S2. The PD-L1, MARCO sinuses Ptx3-LECs are instead associated with a network of scattered B lineage cells Figure S2, a typical feature of the medullary region in the LN, where the lymphatic cords are surrounded by plasma cells 4, 35. Trajectory analysis predicts that Ptx3-LECs are contiguous with the SCS ceiling, which is also evident along the efferent side of the LN where the LYVE-1 outermost endothelial layers cLECs connect to the LYVE-1 cords i.e., Ptx3-LECs Figure S3..

Gray arrowheads indicate Ptx3high paracortical cords. Area between dotted lines indicates Ptx3intermed cords in the central medullary sinus. Scale bars  200 μm. As noted above, trajectory analysis predicts a close relationship between Marco-LECs and fLECs, and identifies a transitional population tzLECs between them. tzLECs are characterized by variable and often intermediate expression of fLEC e.g., Madcam1 and Ccl20 and Marco-LEC associated genes e.g. Marco and Lyve1. Histologic analysis identifies a region of LECs between fLECs and Marco-LECs that displays expression patterns consistent with this transitional phenotype. Cells of this phenotype can be observed between the fLECs and Marco-LECs in the region between the bilateral lobes of the inguinal LN and at the LN margins, where the lining cells display reduced MAdCAM-1 compared to the majority of fLEC and increasing levels of LYVE-1. Few if any genes are specific to tzLECs i.e., not shared with fLECs or Marco-LECs, and unbiased non-negative matrix factorization does not identify a gene set specific to the subset data not shown. Thus, the tzLECs highlighted here are part of a continuum between fLEC and Marco-LEC populations, defining an area of vascular zonation. Consistent with computational predictions, the results favor a model in which Marco-LECs occupy the perifollicular medulla in association to the LN cortex, with the transitional phenotype tzLECs bridging them to the SCS floor.. Transition zone tz: LECs bridging fLECs and Marco-LECs. A Confocal microscopy of inguinal LN from Prox1-GFP transgenic mouse. Immunoreactivity to PROX-1 i.e., GFP blue, LYVE-1 red and MAdCAM-1 green.

B Heatmap of selected DEGs in the C57BL6 mouse 10x LN LEC subsets. Values are imputed log counts row scaled. Hence, we have demonstrated the organization of LEC in situ, with SCS ceiling converging on Ptx3-LECs, Ptx3-LECs to Marco-LECs and tzLECs, then leading to fLECs Figures 24, which mirrors the phenotypic progression revealed by trajectory analysis. A schematic of the LN LEC connections is shown in. LEC Molecular Phenotypes Correspond With Their Vascular Niches and Functions The cLEC Molecular Profile Reflects Interaction With the LN Capsule cLECs connect to afferent and efferent collecting vessels, and co-express several genes with valve-related LECs, including higher levels of Foxc2 36 compared to other LN subsets and Figure S1C. Deletion of Foxc2 in lymphatic vessels has been shown to lead to downregulation of the cLEC marker Ackr4, but also to mislocation of surrounding smooth muscle cells 36. cLECs interact physically with the relatively rigid capsule that surrounds LNs. The capsule is a dense network of connective tissue and hence is a unique extracellular matrix ECM, distinct from other parts of the LN 4. Reflecting this, cLECs are highly enriched for genes encoding ECM proteins, Multimerin protein 1 and 2 Mmrn1 and Mmrn2, together with high levels of Platelet-derived growth factor a and b Pdgfa and Pdgfb, Jagged-1 Jag1 a ligand for Notch receptors on both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and Endothelin 1 Edn1 a vasoactive peptide and known lymphatic constrictor, proteins known to maintain interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells 37, 38 and Figure S4. The capsule was recently shown to have a CD34 stromal cell subset with expression of CD248 6, a ligand for MMRN2. MMRN2 can also interact with cLEC expressed MMRN2-ligand Cd93, which was recently coupled to ECM fibrillogenesis in tumor blood endothelium 39. cLECs express the BMP family members Growth differentiation factor 10 Gdf10 and the Bone morphogenic protein 4 Bmp4, which differentiate cLECs from fLECs as well as bridging cells in the SCS and Figures S4, S5. fLEC instead express Bmp2 and Figures S4, S5. The expression of BMPs may mediate both autocrine and paracrine signaling to the surrounding stromal and immune cells. fLECs: An Immune-Active Subset fLECs are the gatekeeper for lymph-derived immune cell entry into the lymph node parenchyma. In keeping with this role, fLECs are characterized by genes involved in immune cell adhesion including Madcam1, Icam1, Vcam1, and Glycam1, supporting active immune cell migration Figures 1D, 5B and Figure S4. These adhesion receptors may also help retain the closely associated SCS macrophages 17. fLECs are also enriched for chemokines, including the known fLEC marker Ccl20 CCR6 ligand 15, 27 but also Cxcl1 CXCR2 ligand Figures 1D, 5B and Figure S4. CCL20 has been linked to innate lymphoid cell ILC trafficking across the SCS 15 and may affect the cross-talk between CCR6-positive DCs and LECs in antigen presentation 40. CCL20 could also influence B cell homeostasis, as memory B cell precursors are distinguished by high CCR6 expression in lymphoid organs of both mouse and man 41 and are closely associated to the SCS 42. CXCL1 may instead contribute to neutrophil migration and recruitment 43. fLECs and Marco-LECs, both macrophage-rich niches 17, share high expression of Csf1 and Figure S4, and fLECs express Platelet factor 4 Pf4 also known as CXCL4 and Figure S4. CSF-1 and CXCL4 both regulate monocyte and macrophage functions 18, 44 and LEC-derived CSF-1 is required to maintain the LN macrophage niches 18. As mentioned earlier, Bmp2 is specifically expressed by fLECs and Figures S4, S5 that are also enriched for both Smad1 and Smad4 and Figure S4 suggesting a role for BMP-signaling in fLEC homeostasis. Another distinguishing feature of fLECs is their expression of CD74 and Figure S4, the MHC class II-associated invariant chain. CD74 is involved in the formation and transport of MHC class II-antigen complexes 45. Together with high levels of H2-Ab1 and Figure S4, this supports a major role of this subset in LN LEC-mediated antigen presentation. Together with the high expression of PD-L1 Cd274 in fLECs Figures 2, 5B and Figure S4, and given that antigens are continuously transported from afferent lymphatics into the SCS, this places the fLECs as the major niche for LN LEC-mediated tolerance. In contrast to all other subsets, fLECs and tzLECs lacks detectable expression of the scavenger receptor Stabilin 2 Stab2, a sinusoidal endothelial marker 46, and have low expression of the tight junction protein Claudin 5 Cldn5 and Figures S4, S6. The latter suggests that junctional properties of the fLECs differ compared to other LN LECs and may reflect requirements for the active immune migration at this site. Marco-LECs: MARCO Medullary Sinus LECs Immunofluorescence staining for MARCO in mouse inguinal LN shows that it delineates the medullary sinuses adjacent to the B cell follicles in the LN cortex perifollicular sinuses. MARCO expression coincides with PD-L1 expression in the medullary sinuses, and is excluded from the PD-L1 negative medullary sinuses closest to the hilus and Figure S2. Lymph from SCS passes through this lymphatic meshwork, abundant in macrophages that can capture lymph-borne pathogens 17, 47. While MARCO is also marker for medullary macrophages 47, a major part of the MARCO expression within the adult LN is however confined to LECs. MARCO expression is also abundant in human LN medullary sinuses 27, 34. In macrophages, MARCO expression facilitates phagocytic clearance by binding both gram-negative and positive bacteria 48, but its function in LECs is not known. Marco-LECs also express the C-type lectin Clec1b CLEC2 and Figure S4, a ligand for podoplanin PDPN. CLEC2 is also expressed by myeloid cells, including DCs 49, and interaction between PDPN fibroblastic reticular cells FRCs and CLEC2 DCs has been implicated in FRC contractility and LN expansion in inflammation 49, 50. LN LEC-expressed CLEC2 may mediate both homotypic and heterotypic cell interactions, since PDPN is highly expressed by LECs and by surrounding FRCs. Stab2 is highly expressed by Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs Figure S6, and together with Ptx3-LECs they are also enriched for the coagulation factor VIII F8 and Figure S4. We previously showed that LN LECs are a major source of FVIII production 51. The present result shows that F8 along with Stab2 are features of medullary LEC subsets. Their co-expression may be a general feature of sinusoidal EC, since both are also characteristic of hepatic sinusoidal endothelium. FVIII forms a complex with von Willebrand factor vWF in plasma, a complex that is cleared by STAB2-expressing liver sinusoidal blood endothelial cells in a vWF-dependent manner 52. However, the very low expression of vWF by mouse LN LECs 51 and data not shown suggests that FVIII may function as a pro-coagulant factor independent of vWF, possibly promoting the formation of fibrin mesh to block the spread of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus in the medulla 53. The results show that Marco-LECs share gene expression patterns with myeloid cells, suggesting that this LEC subpopulation has a major role in innate immune functions. Interestingly, Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs express higher levels of Kdr, encoding VEGFR2, than other LN subsets and Figure S4, which is discussed in further detail below. Ptx3-LECs: Ptx3 Central Medulla and Paracortical Sinus LECs Marco and Pd-l1 Cd274 Ptx3-LECs uniquely express Pentraxin-3 Ptx3 and. They are also distinguished by expression of Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor 5 Itih5, Mannose receptor C-type 1 Mrc1, Reelin Reln and a relative enrichment in Lyve1 and Stab2 and Figure S4 and Ccl21a, in C57BL6 mice. PTX3 belongs to the pentraxin family: secreted proteins with a cyclic and multimeric structure 54. They bind pathogens and damaged self-proteins, acting as soluble pattern recognition molecules that mediate activation of complement and promote phagocytosis 54. Medullary sinuses also support sustained and close interactions with long-lived plasma cells 35 and thus adaptive antibody-based and innate responses are likely to provide complementary defense mechanisms at this site. Ptx3-LECs share gene expression with dermal capillary LECs, with which they share morphologic features. Both have sprout-like blind ends specialized for attracting leukocytes and fluid flow into the lymphatics 4, 55 Figures 2, 3. Ptx3 itself is not expressed by dermal capillary LEC in mouse, but capillary and Ptx3-LECs share Itih5, Mrc1, Ccl21, and Lyve1 5658 and data not shown. CCL21 mediates recruitment of CCR7 dendritic cells DCs and T cells into dermal lymphatic capillaries 58, 59. Although in the peripheral LN Ptx3-LECs analyzed here Ccl21 expression is relatively low compared with levels in candidate collecting vessels in, it is more highly expressed in Ptx3-LEC in mesenteric LN not shown and in the human LN, as discussed below. Thus, CCL21 in Ptx3-LECs may contribute to leukocyte-LEC interactions and egress of CCR7 cells including naïve B and T cells, possibly complementing the known role of sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P in this process 55, 60. Expression of the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 promotes the transmigration of DCs into blind-ended capillary lymphatic vessels 57. MRC-1, a known marker for subsets of macrophages, binds microorganisms and promotes phagocytosis 48. MRC-1 expression in peripheral lymphatic vessels also facilitates interaction with CD44-expressing immune cells 56, and could thus interact with activated CD44high T cells in egress from the LN. Thus, the paracortical and medullary sinus Ptx3-LECs share with peripheral capillary LECs gene programs for LEC-immune cell interactions, and support lymphocyte entry into medullary sinuses and exit from the LN. Ptx3 itself, as well as other genes selective to Ptx3-LECs, have known or proposed roles in the extracellular matrix ECM 54. PTX3 binds collagen and fibrinogen-domain containing proteins, including ECM components, but also other pattern recognition molecules like C1q and ficolins 61; thus, it may amplify innate pathogen recognition mechanisms and contribute to maintenance and repair of the LN medullary environment. The Ptx3-LEC marker Reelin Reln is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. In the periphery, Reelin is associated with the transition of peripheral capillary vessels to collecting vessels and contributes to the cross-talk between collecting vessel and surrounding smooth-muscle cells 62. ITIH5 was originally isolated in a complex with hyaluronan 63 which can stabilize the ECM 64. Notably, Ptx3-LECs also express high levels of the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 and ITIH-proteins have been shown to interact with PTX3 65. This provides a possible functional link between LYVE-1, ITIH5, and PTX3 in the Ptx3-LEC niche. Ptx3-LECs are also enriched for the collagen and integrin-binding ECM protein TGFbeta-induced protein Tgfbi and Figure S4, which is induced in LECs by hypoxia 66. Together with high levels of the ECM protein Mmrn1 and Figure S4, these genes support the notion of a highly specialized medullary ECM. Ptx3-LECs show the highest levels of Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 Vegfr3, or Flt4 67 and of its co-receptor Neuropilin 2 Nrp2 68 and Figure S4, suggesting a higher responsiveness to vascular endothelial growth factor C VEGFC 69, 70. VEGFC is a major driver of lymphangiogenesis in development 69 and in the adult lymphatic vasculature 71. VEGFR2 Kdr, which binds both VEGFC and VEGFA 67, is also highly expressed in Ptx3-LECs, although it is most enriched in Marco-LECs. Thus, VEGFA and VEGFC may elicit niche-specific responses in medullary sinus LECs, acting differently on Vegfr3high Vegfr2intermed Ptx3-LECs and Vegfr3intermedlow Vegfr2high Marco-LECs. Interestingly, while SCS fLEC and cLECs are established in embryogenesis 36, the medullary sinuses form by sprouting during the first two postnatal weeks 72. Thus, high Vegfr3 Flt4 in Ptx3-LEC could reflect retention of their postnatal programs for VEGFC-dependent sprouting 72, and may imbue them with the capacity to regenerate or expand rapidly in response to the requirements of LN inflammatory responses. It is well-established that it is primarily the LYVE-1 medullary and paracortical sinuses that expand in response to inflammation and in tumor draining LNs 73, 74. The Ptx3-LEC marker Angiopoietin 2 Angpt2 has also been linked to LEC proliferation 75, 76: it can induce lymphatic hyperplasia when overexpressed 76 and is highly expressed by newly formed lymphatic vessels in inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis 75. Ptx3-LECs, like cLECs, but in contrast to all other parenchymal LN LEC subsets, also lack expression of PD-L1 Cd274. Loss of PD-L1 is associated with increased LN LEC proliferation but also increased LEC apoptosis after inflammation 25. Thus, low PD-L1 suggest higher responsiveness not only to proliferation-inducing signals but also higher sensitivity to apoptotic cell death, the latter thought to facilitate LN contraction after inflammatory stimuli 25. Taken together, high Vegfr3, Vegfr2, Nrp2, Angpt2, and low Cd274 PD-L1 suggest a major role of Ptx3-LECs in LN remodeling. A Cellular Bridge Between the SCS Ceiling and Floor As discussed earlier, trajectory analysis not only predicts a transitional population, tzLECs, that link fLEC and Marco-LEC, but further identifies a bridge population that connects cLEC and fLEC. This bridge population is variably represented in the mouse samples and Figure S1A but is prominent in the human see below,. We plotted gene expression of cells along the path from cLEC to fLEC Figure S5 and Figure S7A and found that individual cells within the bridge display variable levels of cLEC and fLEC marker transcripts including Lyve1 Figure S7A, but overall a decreasing gradient of cLEC markers e.g., Ackr4 and Cav1 and an increasing gradient of fLEC markers Madcam1, Pd-l1Cd274 in the progression from cLEC to fLEC Figure S7A. We speculate that these cells participate in formation of previously described transendothelial channels, physical bridges that link the subcapsular ceiling and floor 10, 12, 36. Immunofluorescence imaging indicate that these cords consist not only of channels 10, 36, but also nucleated LECs traversing the sinus, as indicated by nuclear staining for the lymphatic reporter Prox1-GFP Figure S7B. We used immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization for RNA RNAscope to evaluate bridge cell expression of cLEC and fLEC markers Figure S7 and Figure S5. Most bridging cells displayed defining phenotypes of cLEC LYVE-1, PD-L1, MAdCAM-1 or fLEC LYVE-1, PD-L1, MAdCAM-1 on the protein level. Cells co-expressing these cLEC and fLEC markers as predicted for cells of the computationally defined bridge were rare or absent Figure S7. However, RNAscope revealed that bridging cells lack mRNA for Bmp4 cLEC marker and have intermediate expression of Bmp2 fLEC marker, a pattern consistent with the single cell profiles of the predicted bridge Figure S5. Although this observation provides some support for the correspondence between the physical and trajectory-inferred cellular bridges, they are far from being conclusive. An alternative possibility is that fLEC and cLEC can interconvert in response to local environmental signals, and that the transcription profiles of these bridge cells are snapshots of cells in process of these transitions. Further experiments are required to map the computationally defined bridge cells within the LN lymphatic network and to confidently identify the profiles of the in situ cellular links between SCS floor and ceiling. Niche-Specific Inflammatory Responses in LN LECs Oxazolone Oxa is a chemical compound used in a prototypical model for inflammation-induced LN hypertrophy 73. We here chose to look at initial LEC responses 48 h after topical skin application of Oxa, before any major lymphangiogenic responses are expected. Lymphangiogenesis is a late effect in LN remodeling, peaking at 57 days after Oxa, or other inflammatory stimuli 25, 73, 77. We aligned LEC of the Oxa-treated mouse with the untreated control of the same genetic background and observed two new subsets, termed Ox1 and Ox2, in the immunized group.. Niche-specific inflammatory responses in LN LECs. A tUMAP UMAP on trajectory distances of LEC from Oxa-treated and control mice, colored by subsets, including the two additional subsets Ox1 and Ox2 in the Oxa-treated group left. tPC principal components on trajectory distances of LEC from Oxa-treated and control mice, highlighting Ox1 red and Ox2 blue respectively right. B Pairwise Pearson correlation of LEC subsets in Oxa-treated group, calculated using the subset mean expression of the top 1,000 variable genes. C Venn diagrams of DEGs from Ox1 in Oxa-treated LNs compared with fLEC in control LNs, and from Ox2 in Oxa-treated LNs compared with Ptx3-LEC in control LNs upper; p  0.01, fold change  1.2. Heatmaps of 50 select upregulated or downregulated DEGs, with ribosomal genes excluded from the downregulated panel lower; row scaled. D Select GO terms and BioPlanet pathways from Enrichr analysis of DEGs. Inspection of the tSpace projections tUMAP UMAP on trajectory distances and tPC principal components of trajectory distances suggests that Ox1 arises from fLECs, and Ox2 from Ptx3-LECs. Pairwise Pearson correlation based on the top 1,000 variable genes confirmed that Ox1 is most correlated with fLECs Pearson correlation coefficient  0.97 and Ox2 with Ptx3-LECs Pearson correlation coefficient  0.92. We asked which genes were differentially expressed in Ox1 and Ox2 due to Oxa treatment. Compared to fLEC and Ptx3-LEC in untreated LN, respectively, we found that both Ox1 and Ox2 displayed typical interferon IFN responses, with dramatic induction of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 as well as Irf7, the master regulator of type-I IFN-dependent immune responses 78. CXCL9 and CXCL10 bind CXCR3, which mediates recruitment of dendritic cells, NK cells, effector T-cells 79 and, in inflamed LNs, subsets of monocytes 80. Both Ox1 and Ox2 also showed upregulated Psme2, a proteosomal component involved in peptide processing for class I antigen presentation 81. While most gene changes were shared, some were preferentially or more dramatically increased in one or the other subset. Ccl20, which is selectively expressed by fLEC in resting LNs, is highly upregulated in Ox1 but not Ox2, maintaining its selective pattern of expression in the SCS floor Figures 1D, 5B, 6C. Ox1 also displays selective upregulation of Ubiquitin D Ubd, important in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B 82. Oxa controls subset-specific upregulation of monocyte chemoattractants Ccl2 Ox2 and Ccl5 Ox1. CCL5 acts through CCR5, which is expressed by multiple adaptive and innate immune subsets; while CCL2 acts through CCR2 in monocyte recruitment 43. Thus, chemotactic regulations in the SCS and medulla diverge. Gene enrichment analysis confirms Ox1 and Ox2 share enrichment in interferon signaling and immune system signatures, but the subsets also display unique ontologies: e.g., Transforming Growth Factor TGF-beta regulation of ECM in Ox1 and response to Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF in Ox2. Several of the observed changes, including induction of Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl20, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10 were observed previously in analyses of bulk LN LECs in response to HSV-1 virus 77 or after ovalbumin specific T-cell responses 11. Our results link inflammation-induced transcriptional changes to specific LEC subsets, implying that niche-specific changes coordinate LEC-driven responses in early inflammation. Interestingly, in both Ox1 and Ox2, significantly more genes are downregulated than upregulated. Pathway analysis shows downregulation of genes associated with viral gene expression, ribosomes and mRNA processing. This may be a result of the activation of type I interferon signaling, which can cause widespread downregulation of host and viral transcriptional and translational pathways as a defense against viral replication 83, 84. Downregulated genes include Csf1 and Ltb, which is interesting from the perspective of the known transient loss of sinusoidal LN macrophages in acute inflammation 18, 19. Core lymphatic endothelial differentiation genes are also downregulated, including Lyve1 and Cldn5, and subset marker genes are inhibited as well. Ox1 shows reduced expression of fLEC marker genes Cd74 and Bmp2, and Ox2 of Ptx3-LEC marker genes including Stab2 and Tgfbi. In addition to IFN-induced transcriptional repression, another contributing factor may be transcription factor availability, which can dictate level of gene expression 85: TNF-induced RELA-dependent pathways, which are also induced as part of the Oxa response, have been shown to redirect cofactors from super-enhancers, repressing cell identity genes in a cell type dependent manner 86. LEC Phenotypes in Human and Mouse LNs Common Mouse and Human LN LEC Phenotypes We have previously reported LEC diversity and described multiple LEC subsets in human LNs 27. Here we compare our mouse LEC samples to a representative sample of human head and neck LN LECs, selected for its quality, high cell number, and inclusion of each of the subsets we identified. We translated human gene names to their mouse homologs, and integrated human and mouse LECs using Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA 87, which implements a variant of the mutual nearest neighbor algorithm MNN 88. Cross mapping successfully aligned human and mouse LECs, and unsupervised clustering of the aligned cells identified shared but also unique subsets in human LN. The five subsets common to mouse and human cLEC, fLEC, Ptx3-LEC, valve-LEC, and Marco-LEC display high correspondence with human LEC subsets defined previously using unsupervised clustering 27 LEC I, II, IV, V, and VI, respectively. Specifically, the Marco-LEC subset of medullary EC maps to human LEC VI, which we previously characterized as medullary sinus CD209 LECs 27. However, mouse Ptx3-LECs map to human LEC IV, which we postulated to be peripheral capillary LECs 27. We discuss this below.. Cross-mapping of mouse and human LNs reveals conserved LEC populations and additional human cLEC subsets. A UMAP of aligned mouse and human LEC, colored by integrated mouse and human LEC subset left and middle, or human LEC ID as in 27 right. Bridge cells are not shown. B Pairwise overlap scores of top 100 subset-specific DEGs for mouse and human LEC. Overlap score is defined as the ratio between the number of shared genes observed and the number of genes expected to be shared by chance. C Correlation of gene profiles of human LEC subsets. Color scale: pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient, calculated using the mean expression of the top 1000 variable genes left. Expression of cLEC subset-specific genes, projected on UMAP plot of human LN LECs right. D Select pathways from Enrichr analysis of DEGs common to mouse and human. Specialization of the Human SCS Ceiling Unsupervised clustering aligned the mouse cLECs with one subset of the human cLECs, core cLECs, which we identified previously as LEC I 27, but additional cLEC subsets cLEC s1, s2, and s3 were unique to the analyzed human LN. Pearson correlation analysis reveals similarity of these subsets with the core cLECs. cLEC s3 is most similar to the core cLEC population as indicated by correlation and hierarchical clustering, UMAP, and differentially expressed genes DEGs data not shown: we do not discuss this subset further. cLEC s1 corresponds to MFAP4 SCS LEC LEC III, which we located overlying the human LN medulla 27. Consistent with this, cLEC s1 clusters close to Ptx3-LECs, and links other cLECs to Ptx3-LECs in trajectory space see below. cLEC s2, which we did not segregate previously, uniquely expresses high levels of Hairyenhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein HEY1, the chemokine CCL2, and E-Selectin SELE data not shown, suggestive of an activated state. Both E-selectin and CCL2 are induced by inflammation in endothelial cells and regulate leukocyte recruitment 89. Based on HEY1 and SELE expression, the subset is identifiable in 3 of the 6 human LN samples we studied previously 27 data not shown. The findings suggest greater heterogeneity and specialization in SCS ceiling LEC in humans than in the resting specific-pathogen-free SPF mice studied here. The subset specialization of human cLEC may relate to local differences in immune environments, or to the more complex architecture of the human LN. Unlike the mouse, human cLECs participate in invaginations of the capsule, known as trabecular sinuses 4, which may experience more turbulent flow of the incoming lymph and hence variation in shear stress. Comparisons of Human and Mouse LEC Differentially Expressed Genes DEG To evaluate similarities between species, we compared DEGs of mouse and human LEC subsets using a gene overlap score, defined as the ratio of the number of shared DEGs to the number of genes expected to be shared based on random chance, for each combination of mouse and human subsets. In all instances, the highest overlap scores are seen between corresponding subsets. Based on overlap scores, cLECs are more conserved than the more immunologically active subsets fLECs, Marco-LECs, and Ptx3-LECs. The floor and medullary sinus subsets showed less conserved DEG profiles, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure in response to pathogens, contrasting with conservation of structural functions of cLECs. Gene set enrichment analysis based on conserved genes has the potential to highlight core functions of the LEC subsets. Shared cLEC genes are involved in focal adhesion, fluid shear stress response and ECM interaction, consistent with their structural role and association to the capsule. Ptx3-LECs are enriched in genes for endocytosis and lysosome, which could relate to the high expression of scavenger receptors e.g., Lyve1, Stab1, Stab2. Marco-LECs are enriched for lysosomal genes, and for genes of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway as well as the coagulation and complement cascades. fLECs display high enrichment for inflammatory pathways, including JAK-STAT and Nuclear Factor NF-kappa B, and are enriched for genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, supporting their immunomodulatory properties. A number of mouse key subset specific marker DEGs are shared in the human, including fLECs: Bmp2, Ccl20, Cd74, and Csf1; cLECs: Ackr4, Bmp4, and Cav1; Marco-LECs: Marco, Clec4g, and C2; and Ptx3-LECs: Ptx3, Nrp2, and Flt4 Vegfr3. We illustrate expression of these and other select shared marker genes in.. Conserved gene programs for mouse and human LEC specialization. Expression of select gene homologs or paralogs Itih5 and ITIH3 in cLECs, fLECs, Ptx3-LECs, Marco-LECs and valve LECs. Color indicates subset mean log transcript count, normalized within each subset. Dot size indicates subset mean log transcript count, scaled to the maximum value for each gene. As noted above, mouse Marco-LECs align with LEC VI, which we identified previously as the major medullary sinus subset in human LNs 27. Unexpectedly, mouse Ptx3-LECs align with a subset LEC IV that we previously related to capillary LECs based on their enrichment for expression of Ccl21 and Lyve1 27, gene markers of peripheral capillary lymphatic vessels 57, 58. However, these genes are also expressed by mouse Ptx3-LECs Figures 1D, 5B, 8, and as noted earlier, their expression likely reflects the parallels with capillary LEC in morphology blind ends, loose EC junctions and function recruiting fluid and lymphocytes into lymph 4. Supporting a medullary identity, Ptx3-LECs and LEC IV share high levels the sinusoidal endothelial marker Stab2STAB2 46, shown to be expressed by medullary sinuses in human LNs 90. Importantly, human Ptx3-LECs LEC IV also share expression of PTX3 and lack PD-L1 CD274 expression, similar to their mouse counterpart; and they express the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor gene family member ITIH3, functionally related to the mouse Ptx3-LEC marker Itih5 64. Ptx3-LECs in both humans and mice are distinguished from Marco-LECs by higher expression of the glycoprotein and scavenger receptor CD36, also known as Fatty Acid Translocase FAT. Staining of CD36 in human head and neck LNs identified capillary-like, CD36high LYVE-1 lymphatic cords, negative for MARCO and the Marco-LEC LEC VI 27 marker CLEC4M Figures 9B,C. These CD36high lymphatic sinuses were found either as isolated cords in the paracortex Figures 9B,C or as extended sprouts from MARCO CLEC4M medullary sinuses, similar to mouse Ptx3-LECs which connects to Marco-LECs in perifollicular regions. Human Ptx3-LECs are also distinguished from Marco-LECs by high expression of PDPN and CCL21, as predicted by the transcriptional profiles Figure S8, while both medullary subsets express LYVE-1 and STAB2 Figure S8. Thus, cross-species comparison of single-cell profiles and in situ analysis support that human and mouse share two distinct niches of paracortical and medullary sinus LECs: MARCO LECs, which correspond to the previously published CD209 medullary sinus LEC subset LEC VI 27, and Ptx3-LECs, PDPNhigh, CD36high paracortical and medullary sinus LECs, corresponding to LEC IV 27 in our earlier classification of human LN LECs. Notably, human and mouse LN LECs also share the in situ physical transition between Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs, as predicted in trajectory analysis Figures 1C, 10A, discussed below..

B Expression pattern of indicated genes. Marco-LEC, Ptx3-LEC, and cLEC s1 populations are highlighted. Values are batch-corrected imputed log counts. Species-Specific Gene Expression A number of genes with homologs in mouse and human are not conserved in expression, or display different patterns of subset selectivity. Here we highlight select examples for discussion Figure S9. As noted earlier, the mouse fLEC markers Madcam1 and Msr1 are poorly expressed by human LECs 27 data not shown. ACKR1, also known as DARC Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines, marks human fLECs and Marco-LECs, but Ackr1 has very low expression in mouse LN LECs, without clear subset selectivity Figure S9B. Consistent with this, endothelial ACKR1 in mouse is restricted to venular blood vessels, with only sparse and low detection in LECs 91. ACKR1 is a chemokine interceptor, which can serve as a sink for a large range of inflammatory chemokines 92. Its expression could reflect a greater need to moderate inflammatory chemokines in the human. Alternatively, it may facilitate transport of chemokines across the lymphatic endothelium in the human LN, as ACKR1 has been shown to shuttle chemokines across endothelial cell layers 93. Several ACKR1 ligands are expressed by human fLECs including CXCL3 and CXCL5 27. Human but not mouse LN LECs also display high expression of IL6 in fLECs Figure S9B, likely reflecting a higher inflammatory basal state in human, especially compared to our SPF mice. Human Ptx3-LECs express MMP2 and LOX, genes missing in mouse LECs or expressed in different subsets i.e., Lox expressed weakly in cLECs in mouse Figure S9B. Both Matrix metalloproteinase 2 MMP2 and Lysyl oxidase LOX can contribute to ECM modulation 94, 95, suggesting that, although matrix interplay is conserved, the specific mechanisms of matrix interaction in this population of LECs may have diverged. Mouse-specific LN LEC DEGs include Apolipoprotein E ApoE in cLECs and medullary sinus populations and Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 Rgs4 in fLECs Figure S9B. Carboxypeptidase E Cpe and Carbonic anhydrase 8 Car8 are examples of genes with different expression pattern across mouse and mouse LN LEC subsets Figure S9B. Since scRNA-seq is often unable to detect low abundance transcripts, the apparent lack of expression of a gene must be interpreted with caution: the expression pattern of the genes mentioned here have been observed in each of our samples. In addition, CD209 and CLEC4M, which lack orthologs in mouse 27, are specific for human Marco-LECs. We described them previously as medullary sinus markers 27. Human IL32 and mouse Glycam1 also lack orthologs. IL-32 potently amplifies inflammatory responses by induction of multiple cytokines 96; it is highly expressed by human Ptx3-LECs data not shown. GLYCAM1, a secreted mucin that on high endothelial venules is decorated with glycotopes for leukocyte selectins 97, is selectively expressed by mouse fLEC and Figure S4. The Continuum of Human LEC Phenotypes in Trajectory Space We have focused to this point on comparing subsets of human and mouse LECs, but as illustrated for the mouse, LECs exist in a phenotypic continuum that may reflect physical alignments spatial transitions, developmental sequences, or both. To gain further insight into LEC diversity and zonation within human LNs, we ran tSpace on combined LN LECs from our six previously published human samples 27. In the tSpace projections in, cell identities are determined based on correlation with the core subsets in our index human LN left or based on unsupervised clustering as previously 27 right. Alignment of human LECs in trajectory space reveals both similarities and differences to the mouse. Shared subsets are aligned in the same order as in the mouse, with links from Valve-LECs to cLECs, Ptx3-LECs, Marco-LECs and finally fLECs compare with mouse alignments in Figures 1B,C. However, in the human, the cellular bridge between cLECs and fLECs is highly populated with cells. The human-specific cLEC subsets also show interesting alignments. cLEC s2 appears closely linked to the bridge. cLEC s1, which we previously identified as SCS ceiling LEC overlying the medulla LEC III 27, extends toward and links prominently to Ptx3-LECs see arrows: Cells from both subsets within this Ptx3-LECs-to-cLEC s1 trajectory express PTX3 itself, and are highly enriched in CCL21, suggesting a relationship of PTX3 medullary sinuses and the perihilar ceiling. Supporting this notion, RNAscope of a neonatal human LN showed extensive PTX3 in the medulla of the hilar region data not shown. Co-expression of CCL21 and SPHK1 enzyme required for S1P production support a role of Ptx3-LECs in lymphocyte egress. Heterogeneity in ANGPT2 also exists along the Ptx3-LEC paths. The alignments outlined here are not an artifact of the high cell number or integration of LEC from different LNs, because the same patterns and linkages are seen in independent tSpace projections of our index LN sample not shown. Human LN LECs thus display numerous intermediate phenotypes and complex zonation that may reflect the complexity of human LN architecture observed histologically. Summary and Outlook The LN lymphatic vasculature provides a complex lymphatic vascular bed, adapted to a unique microenvironment where cooperation between stromal cells and immune cells forms the basis for effective immune cell interaction and activation. Endothelial cells in this environment not only need to provide a framework for the structural organization of the organ, but also need to be able to adapt to constant changes induced by immunological stimuli and organ expansion in LN hypertrophy, and to support tolerogenic immune reactions in homeostasis. We define five LN LEC subsets in mouse: valve LECs, the SCS Ackr4 cLECs, the immune active Ccl20 fLECs, as well as Ptx3-LECs and Marco-LECs, two paracortical and medullary sinus subsets that were not recognized previously. Single-cell gene profiles indicate niche-specific functional specialization of these subsets with distinct pathways for pathogen interactions and matrix modeling. Interestingly, cross-species mapping with human LN LECs shows that both subsets as well as their respective functions are conserved, which allows us to redefine the subset previously identified as candidate capillary LECs LEC IV 27 in human LN to paracortical sinus Ptx3-LECs. PTX3 and MARCO, gene markers chosen here to designate the two distinct medullary LEC subsets, are conserved both in their expression patterns among LEC subsets and also in protein sequence between humans and mice 92 homology PTX3 and 69 MARCO, suggesting that they may have conserved functions as well. Recently developed algorithms have made important advances in solving the complex problem of integrating different datasets 8799. As shown here, they not only perform well in combining sample replicates by removing batch effects, but can also identify and map similar subsets of cells across species barriers. Mutual nearest neighbors and CCA algorithms not only mapped human LEC subsets to mouse counterparts, but also uncovered species-specific LN LEC subset compositions, revealing a greater diversity of SCS ceiling LEC in human. We can look forward to continuing advances in computational approaches to integrating and mining scRNA-seq data. Particularly exciting is the power of trajectory inference to recapitulate or predict the organization of endothelial cells within the complex vascular networks. While trajectory analysis has been shown to model sequences of cell phenotypes in development pseudotime 30, our results both in lymphatics here and blood vascular EC studies 31 show that computed alignments of cells in trajectory space reflect the tissue architecture spatial organization and physical relationships between endothelial cells in situ with surprising faithfulness. This correspondence implies, as an approximation, that endothelial cell phenotypes progress in a gradual and orderly fashion within the linear arrangements as in vascular tubes or sheets as in the SCS and sinus-lining LECs in the LN that make up the endothelium. In essence, trajectories provide a computational roadmap for mapping gene expression to the vascular endothelium. The results underscore the diversity of endothelial cells as a continuum, punctuated by concentrations of particular phenotypes or niches that are identified as subsets. Whether the progression of phenotypes and zonation among LN LECs reflects malleable LEC responses to local niche factors, retention of a programmed developmental response, or both, remains to be determined. Our studies here demonstrate the power of single-cell profiling to illuminate the biology of the vascular endothelium, and the promise it holds to revolutionize our understanding of conserved and species-specific regulation of the vasculature and its responses in physiology and human disease. Materials and Methods Mice Male and female 68-week-old BALBcJ or 812-week-old C57BL6J peripheral LNs inguinal, axillary and brachial processed by 10x Genomics workflow, or 20-week-old Prox1-GFPC57BL6J 33 female inguinal LNs processed by SMART-seq2 workflow were used for scRNA-seq. Mice were bred and maintained in the animal facilities at Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal. In addition, mice were held at a Specific Pathogen Free SPF facility Uppsala University, and experimental procedures were approved by the local animal ethics committee at the Uppsala County Court 600917. Immune Challenge BALBcJ mice were subjected to cutaneous Oxazolone Oxa challenge by applying 5 4-Ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one Sigma-Aldrich in acetone and olive oil topical to the skin as described 73. Axillary, brachial, and inguinal draining LNs were harvested 48 h after immunization. Tissue Dissociation and Single-Cell Library Preparation Cell isolation for 10x: Single-cell suspensions of total EC were generated as previously described 100. For each group, axillary, inguinal, and brachial LNs from 25 to 30 male and female BALBcJ or C57BL6J mice were combined, minced, washed with Hanks Balanced Salt solution, and dissociated for 30 min at 37C with gentle rocking in HBSS with calcium and magnesium medium containing 0.2 mgml Collagenase P, 0.8 mgml Dispase II, and 0.01 mgml DNase I Sigma-Aldrich adapted from 14. Hematopoietic cells were depleted with anti-CD45 mouse MicroBeads according to the manufacturers protocol Miltenyi and the remaining cells were stained with anti-CD31 BV605 clone 390 and anti-PDPN PE-Cy7 clone 8.1.1 antibodies, as well as dump antibodies consisting of anti-CD45 clone 30-F11, anti-EpCAM clone G8.8, anti-TER119 clone TER-119, anti-CD11a clone H155-78, and anti-CD11b clone M170 in PerCP-Cy5.5. Total EC lin CD31 were sorted into 100 fetal bovine serum using FACS Aria III BD Biosciences; 100 um nozzle; 2,500 cellss, washed, and immediately processed to generate scRNA-seq library using Chromium Single Cell 3 Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 10x Genomics according to manufacturers instructions. Libraries were sequenced with NextSeq 500 Illumina using 150 cycles high output V2 kit Read 1: 26 bp, Read 2: 98 bp at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility. Cell isolation for SMART-seq2: Inguinal LN digests from Prox1-GFP mice 33, depleted for hematopoietic cells as described above, were stained with anti-CD31 PE-Cy7 clone 390, anti-PDPN AF660 clone eBio8.11 antibodies Thermo Fisher Scientific. Dump channel included anti-mouse TER-119 eFluor450 clone Ter119, anti-mouse CD45 eFluor450 clone 30-F11, anti-mouse CD11b eFluor450 clone M170, and dead cell staining SYTOX Blue Thermo Fisher Scientific. Triple positive live cells GFP PDPN CD31 LECs were gated and sorted on a BD FACSAria III BD Biosciences 100 um nozzle, 20 psi as single cells into a 384 well plate with lysis buffer. Single cell libraries were prepared as described and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 101. Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Analysis 10x Genomics: Read alignment and quality control were performed using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v3.0.2 and the mm10 reference genome. Loupe Cell Browser v3.1.1; 10x Genomics was used to manually gate on LEC Pdpn CD31 for downstream analysis. SMART-seq2: After lane demultiplexing, SMART-seq2 based FASTQ files were trimmed with Trim Galore v0.4.4 followed by alignment of the data to the mouse reference genome mm10-GRCm38 using TopHat v2.1.1 and bowtie2 v2.2.6.0. PCR duplicates were removed using SAMtools v0.1.18. Counting of fragments aligning per gene was done using the featurecounts function of the Subread package v1.4.6-p5. Count data were processed with the Seurat package v3.1.0 87, 99. For quality control, genes that were expressed in fewer than three cells and cells that expressed fewer than 100 genes were excluded from analysis. Raw counts were log normalized, and 2000 most variable genes were identified based on a variance stabilizing transformation. To correct for batch differences, variable gene sets were used to align multiple datasets for joint analysis, using the Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA method within the FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions of the Seurat package, which implements a variant of the mutual nearest neighbors MNN algorithm. Correspondences between single cells across datasets were identified and multiple datasets were transformed into a shared space. Principal Component Analysis PCA dimensionality reduction was performed using the variable gene sets. Cell clusters were determined using a Shared Nearest Neighbor SNN modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm of the Seurat FindClusters function, and were visualized with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding tSNE 102 or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP 103. Contaminating pericyte, immune and blood endothelial cells were removed by supervised gating on the tSNE plot. To recover gene-gene relationships that are lost due to dropouts, we imputed missing gene expression data from log normalized count data using an in-house customization https:github.comkbruloismagicBatch of the MAGIC Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells algorithm with optimized parameters t  2, k  9, ka  3 104. Imputed data were used for visualization of single-cell gene expression in violin plots and heatmaps 105, as well as for trajectory analyses. Nearest Neighbor Alignments in Trajectory Space tSpace was used to model the nearest neighbor relationships as well as transitional zones between LEC subsets 30. Mapping of cells in trajectory space allows unsupervised reconstruction and exploration of complex developmental sequences, without implementation of cell clustering or manifold distortion for graphical expedience. Batch effects were removed using the fastMNN function of the batchelor package v1.0.1 88 and variable genes were identified using the scran package 106. For mouse LEC, we used tSpace with default parameters T  100, K  20, 5 graphs, 20 way points, Euclidean distance metric and imputed expression values of the top 800 variable genes Figures 1C, 6A, right panel or batch-corrected low-dimensional coordinates top 50 coordinates, left panel. The trajectory matrices were visualized in low dimensional space using PCA Figures 1C, 6A, right panel or UMAP, left panel within the tSpace package. For combined human LEC samples, imputed data of LEC from 6 LNs were batch-corrected as above. Twenty PCs from the 1000 variable genes were calculated, the loadings were adjusted to a minimum value of 0 by addition of a constant and used as input to the tSpace algorithm T  200, K  25, 5 graphs, 10-way points, cosine distance metric. Differential Gene Expression and Gene Enrichment Analysis Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the negative binomial generalized linear model within the FindMarkers function of Seurat on log normalized count data p  0.01, fold change  1.2. To identify subset-defining genes, single-cell transcriptomes of cells in the subset of interest were compared to those of all other cells within the same sample. Only upregulated DEGs were considered, unless otherwise specified. Gene enrichment analysis of DEGs with Gene Ontology 107, 108, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 109, 110, and BioPlanet 111 databases was performed using Enrichr 112, 113. Correlation Analysis To determine similarities between LEC subsets, mean gene expression values were calculated for each subset. The top 1000 most variable genes across all subsets were used for pairwise Pearson correlation analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the average linkage method. Cross Species Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Human HNLN1 dataset GSE124494 27 was used for the integrated LEC profiling. Human gene names were converted to their mouse homologs using the biomaRt package v2.40.4 114. scRNA-seq datasets were integrated in Seurat for unsupervised clustering. The top 100 most upregulated DEGs for each subset, as ranked by the fold change of gene expression in the subset relative to other LEC combined, were determined for human LEC and separately for mouse. An overlap score was defined as the number of DEGs common to one human subset and one mouse subset divided by the number of genes expected to be shared by the two subsets by chance. For each pair of mouse subset and human subsets, overlap score  n  A  B  N, where n  number of observed overlapping genes between the top 100 DEGs of the human subset and the mouse subset, A  number of DEGs considered in the mouse subset 100, B  number of DEGs considered in the human subset with mouse homologs, and N  total number of genes detected in both mouse and human LEC, 13,458. Reanalysis of Human LEC Datasets For the combined analysis of human LEC samples 27, imputed gene expression data were batch-corrected and used for trajectory analysis as above. LEC in each of the additional five human samples were classified by correspondence to the index human subsets that mapped with mouse subsets as follows: reference subset mean gene expression was generated from the index HNLN1 human dataset, using core cells of each major subset that cross-mapped with mouse subsets, as well as manually gated bridge cells that link fLEC and cLEC in tSpace projections. Cells in the other human samples were classified by Pearson correlation using the 1000 most variable genes in the reference set. Immunostaining of Mouse LNs Inguinal and popliteal mouse LNs were harvested from Prox1-GFP mice 33 and fixed in 0.8 paraformaldehyde PFA for 12 h at 4C.

Single-cell transcriptomics promise to revolutionize our understanding of the vasculature.

Clustering identifies five well-delineated subsets, including two medullary sinus subsets not previously recognized as distinct. Nearest neighbor alignments in trajectory space position the major subsets in a sequence that recapitulates the known features and suggests novel features of LN lymphatic organization, providing a transcriptional map of the lymphatic endothelial niches and of the transitions between them. Differences in gene expression reveal specialized programs for 1 subcapsular ceiling endothelial interactions with the capsule connective tissue and cells; 2 subcapsular floor regulation of lymph borne cell entry into the LN parenchyma and antigen presentation; and 3 pathogen interactions and 4 LN remodeling in distinct medullary subsets. LEC of the subcapsular sinus floor and medulla, which represent major sites of cell entry and exit from the LN parenchyma respectively, respond robustly to oxazolone inflammation challenge with enriched signaling pathways that converge on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Integration of mouse and human single-cell profiles reveals a conserved cross-species pattern of lymphatic vascular niches and gene expression, as well as specialized human subsets and genes unique to each species. The examples provided demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis in elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, vascular organization, and endothelial cell responses. We discuss the findings from the perspective of LEC functions in relation to niche formations in the unique stromal and highly immunological environment of the LN. ORIGINAL RESEARCH article Front.

Introduction Lymph nodes LNs serve as hubs for the interaction and communication between tissue-derived and blood-derived immune cells 1. Integrated along the large collecting lymphatic vessels, they are vital sensors of tissue damage, constantly sampling the incoming lymph 2. The LN comprises a complex network of lymphatic sinuses surrounding a dense parenchyma, which mainly consists of immune cells but also specialized blood vessels and a network of mesenchymal cells 13. Segregated B cell cortex and T cell paracortex areas characterize the LN architecture 4. It is well-established that the LN stromal cells play a central role in maintaining both this structure and the immunological functions of the LN, providing chemotactic cues, cytokines, and a structural reticular framework that guide immune cell positioning, migration, survival, and activation reviews: 3, 5. Single-cell sequencing has enabled delineation of nine distinct clusters of murine LN mesenchymal cell phenotypes 6 underlining the complexity needed to maintain the LN structure and coordinate immunity. The lymphatic vasculature is the first structural component of the LN encountered by incoming lymph-borne molecules or cells. Recent studies have revealed an intriguing regional specialization and cellular heterogeneity that characterize the LN lymphatic endothelium and differentiate the LN lymphatic endothelial cells LECs from LECs in peripheral lymphatic vessels 712. Subset-specific markers with functional implications include the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR4 also known as CCRL1, specifically expressed by the LEC layer that forms the ceiling cLECs of the subcapsular sinus SCS 9, where lymph enters from the afferent collecting vessels. ACKR4 is a scavenger receptor for the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 13 and controls entry of tissue-derived dendritic cells DCs into the LN through controlling the formation of CCL21 chemokine gradients across the SCS 9. Leukocyte entry occurs primarily through the SCS floor LECs fLECs, which in mouse express the mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 MAdCAM-1 7, 14 among other adhesion and attractant molecules that can control leukocyte transmigration 7, 15. The SCS also functions as a physical barrier and gateway, enabling size-restricted access of antigens to the LN parenchyma 16: the glycoprotein plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein PLVAP, together with cLEC-expressed caveolin 1 CAV1 10, form sieve-like diaphragms in the transendothelial channels that bridge the SCS to the conduit system and descend from the SCS floor 10. This structural barrier is complemented by a dense network of macrophages closely associated with SCS, providing essential innate immune functions and a filtering system for pathogens 17. The SCS and medullary sinus macrophage niches in the LN were recently shown to be dependent on LEC-expressed CSF-1 colony stimulating factor 1 18 and receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B RANKRANKL signaling between the LN LECs and SCS lining mesenchymal cells 19. LN LECs can also directly influence adaptive immune responses, either through presentation of tissue antigens, which contributes to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance 2022, or by serving as reservoirs for antigens 23. LN LECs express the immune-checkpoint ligand programmed death-ligand 1 PD-L1 also known as CD274 7, 24, an inhibitor of T cell activation, and lack expression of co-stimulatory genes 24, which may explain their role in tolerance. PD-L1 is expressed selectively in the floor of the SCS fLECs, cortical sinuses, and parts of the medulla 7, 24. Genes that influence the communication between LECs and their surroundings could contribute to endothelial regulation as well, and interestingly, PD-L1 expression moderates proliferation and enhances survival of LN LECs in inflammation 25. The diverse and site-specific specialization of the LN lymphatic endothelium is at least partly dependent on crosstalk with immune cells, with contributions from B cells, T cells 7, 26, and mesenchymal stromal cells 19. Hence, the LNs provide both a unique model system to explore endothelial cell interactions with their surroundings and a model for exploring endothelial diversity and phenotypic plasticity. Our recent single-cell analysis of the human LN LECs revealed the complexity and specialization of the LN lymphatic endothelium in man 27. A detailed profiling of the mouse lymphatic endothelium and comparison of human and mouse LN lymphatic endothelium is still missing. Here we provide single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the mouse LN lymphatic vasculature. We show that computational alignments relationships revealed by nearest neighbor trajectory inference recapitulate key aspects of the tissue architecture and predict physical relationships between LN LECs in the tissue, illustrating the power of single-cell analysis for understanding the organization of the vascular endothelium. Cross-species analyses further allowed us to define conserved and divergent LEC phenotypes and lymphatic vascular niches. Notably, the analysis delineates two specialized subsets of medullary sinus LECs, present in both mouse and human that are distinct in gene expression and location in the LN. Using the mouse LN response to cutaneous oxazolone as a model, we show that sites of immune cell entry and exit from the LN, fLECs, and paracortical sinuses, respectively, respond rapidly to inflammation, whereas structurally important cLECs are less affected. Together, the results demonstrate the power of bioinformatic tools for elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, physical relationships, and cellular responses in complex vascular beds, and provide a basis for future detailed analysis of human and mouse LN LEC responses in disease. Results and Discussion Single-Cell Trajectories Model Tissue Architecture and Physical Relationships Between LN LECs To assess the heterogeneity of the lymphatic vasculature and the relationships between lymphatic vascular niches, we analyzed lin podoplanin PDPN CD31 cells from mouse peripheral LNs i.e., axillary, brachial and inguinal by single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics system. An independent set of LN LECs was sorted as single cells and subjected to SMART-seq2 analysis 28. Prospero homeobox protein 1 Prox1 was used as a pan-LEC marker in the analysis 29. Blood endothelial cells Flt1Ly6c1, immune cells Cd45, and pericytes Pdgfra or Pdgfrb were identified by marker gene expression and excluded from further analysis. We used a combination of unsupervised clustering and graph-based methods to determine LEC subsets; Methods.. Mouse LN LEC subsets revealed by 10x and SMART-seq2. A Experimental workflow. Mouse peripheral LNs were isolated and dissociated into single-cell suspensions. Hematopoietic cells were MACS-depleted, and EC linCD31 were FACS-sorted for single-cell sequencing using the droplet-based 10x Genomics system or the SMART-seq2 workflow figure created with BioRender.com. B tSNE plots of 4252 LECs processed by 10x left and 383 LECs by SMART-seq2 right. Cells are colored by subset. Numbers indicate the continuum of the lymphatic endothelium. C tSpace analysis of single-cell trajectories depicting nearest neighbor alignments of LECs. D Expression of LEC subset defining genes in C57BL6 mouse 10x. Dots indicate mean log-normalized transcript count. In addition to gene profile-based dimensionality reduction with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding tSNE and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP see below, we used a trajectory analysis algorithm, tSpace 30, to define high dimensional nearest neighbor alignments that emphasize the continuum of cell phenotypes and reveal transitions between related cells. In developing cell systems, trajectory inference methods can model developmental sequence pseudotime 30. In the resting adult vascular endothelium, they facilitate computational modeling of vessel architecture 27, 31. Subsets and alignments were shared in mice with different genetic backgrounds C57BL6 and BALBc Figure S1A. Cells from both male and female mice were represented in the dataset and comprised similar phenotypes Figure S1B. However, the study was not designed or powered to examine strain- or sex-dependent differences in LN LECs, and these remain to be further explored. Our analyses identified major clusters representing LN cLECs and fLECs based on the expression of known SCS ceiling marker Ackr4 9 as well as SCS floor markers Madcam1 7, 14 and the chemokine Ccl20 15, 27 and Figure S1C. Candidate valve-related LECs display high expression of known lymphatic valve markers, including the transcription factor Forkhead box protein C2 Foxc2 32 and Figure S1C. A minor cluster, most apparent in tSpace projections and associated with valve, expressed higher levels of peripheral lymphatic vessels markers including lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 Lyve1 and the chemokine Ccl21, together with lower expression of Foxc2 compared to the candidate valve LECs. This population likely represents collector or pre-collector LECs 2, 32. These subsets were poorly represented in our data and we discuss them in the context of the architecture of LN LECs, but exclude them from detailed differential gene expression analyses below. Unsupervised clusters separate Lyve1 high candidate medullary sinus LEC into two subsets, referred to here as Ptx3-LECs Ptx3 and Marco-LECs Marco and Figure S1C. Alignment of LECs in tSpace visualization recapitulates known connections within the complex lymphatic endothelial network in LN and reveals previously unappreciated relationships as well as intermediate, putative transitional phenotypes. In addition to the subsets identified by clustering, we highlight two transitional populations here, for discussion below. Transition zone tzLECs comprise a link between fLECs and Marco-LECs in tSpace. Additionally, a minor bridge population B aligns along a direct path between fLECs and cLECs in tSpace projection. As emphasized by numbering of subsets in and illustrated schematically in, trajectories starting from candidate collecting LECs 1 lead prominently to valve 2 and to SCS ceiling LEC 3, consistent with their known physical connections. cLECs branch to fLECs through the bridging population B but also transition prominently to Ptx3-LECs 4, Ptx3-LECs to Marco-LECs 5, and Marco-LECs via tzLECs 6 to fLEC 7 along a phenotypic sequence or path that is well-represented in all LEC datasets here. In situ Localization of LN LEC Subsets To define LEC subsets and their niches in situ, we carried out immunofluorescence staining using antibodies to subset differentiating markers predicted from gene expression in inguinal LNs of Prox1-GFP reporter mice 33, where all LECs express the fluorescent reporter GFP. scRNA-seq predicts that LYVE-1 is absent in cLECs and low in fLECs, but is highly expressed in Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs. Staining for LYVE-1 highlights the cortical, paracortical, and entire medullary region of mouse inguinal LN Figures 2A,B. Expression of Cd274, which encodes the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1, distinguishes fLECs, Marco-LECs, and tzLECs Cd274high from Ptx3-LECs Cd274low and Figure S1C. Co-immunostaining of PD-L1 and LYVE-1 shows that PD-L1 expression defines the fLECs and discrete regions of LYVE-1high medullary sinus LECs that are distant from the hilus. Expression of Marco, which encodes the scavenger receptor Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure MARCO, is highly selective for Marco-LECs: MARCO is a known medullary sinus marker in human LN 27, 34. We show that MARCO expression pattern in the mouse LN medulla selectively overlaps with that of PD-L1. Conversely, in situ hybridization for Ptx3 RNAscope specifically outlines the central medullary sinuses with particularly strong signals in the paracortical cords Figures 3A,B, overlapping with the area of LYVE-1high PD-L1 MARCO cords outlined by protein staining. Co-staining of MARCO and the B-cell marker B220 shows that MARCOhigh regions start from the cortical areas defined based on presence of B-cell follicles and extend into the peri-follicular medulla of both inguinal and popliteal LNs Figure S2. The PD-L1, MARCO sinuses Ptx3-LECs are instead associated with a network of scattered B lineage cells Figure S2, a typical feature of the medullary region in the LN, where the lymphatic cords are surrounded by plasma cells 4, 35. Trajectory analysis predicts that Ptx3-LECs are contiguous with the SCS ceiling, which is also evident along the efferent side of the LN where the LYVE-1 outermost endothelial layers cLECs connect to the LYVE-1 cords i.e., Ptx3-LECs Figure S3..

Right panel: Ptx3 magenta shown together with Stab2 green, a shared marker for Ptx3- and Marco-LECs. B Region of interest ROI white boxed area in A. Gray arrowheads indicate Ptx3high paracortical cords. Area between dotted lines indicates Ptx3intermed cords in the central medullary sinus. Scale bars  200 μm. As noted above, trajectory analysis predicts a close relationship between Marco-LECs and fLECs, and identifies a transitional population tzLECs between them. tzLECs are characterized by variable and often intermediate expression of fLEC e.g., Madcam1 and Ccl20 and Marco-LEC associated genes e.g. Marco and Lyve1. Histologic analysis identifies a region of LECs between fLECs and Marco-LECs that displays expression patterns consistent with this transitional phenotype. Cells of this phenotype can be observed between the fLECs and Marco-LECs in the region between the bilateral lobes of the inguinal LN and at the LN margins, where the lining cells display reduced MAdCAM-1 compared to the majority of fLEC and increasing levels of LYVE-1. Few if any genes are specific to tzLECs i.e., not shared with fLECs or Marco-LECs, and unbiased non-negative matrix factorization does not identify a gene set specific to the subset data not shown. Thus, the tzLECs highlighted here are part of a continuum between fLEC and Marco-LEC populations, defining an area of vascular zonation. Consistent with computational predictions, the results favor a model in which Marco-LECs occupy the perifollicular medulla in association to the LN cortex, with the transitional phenotype tzLECs bridging them to the SCS floor..

B Heatmap of selected DEGs in the C57BL6 mouse 10x LN LEC subsets. Values are imputed log counts row scaled. Hence, we have demonstrated the organization of LEC in situ, with SCS ceiling converging on Ptx3-LECs, Ptx3-LECs to Marco-LECs and tzLECs, then leading to fLECs Figures 24, which mirrors the phenotypic progression revealed by trajectory analysis. A schematic of the LN LEC connections is shown in. LEC Molecular Phenotypes Correspond With Their Vascular Niches and Functions The cLEC Molecular Profile Reflects Interaction With the LN Capsule cLECs connect to afferent and efferent collecting vessels, and co-express several genes with valve-related LECs, including higher levels of Foxc2 36 compared to other LN subsets and Figure S1C. Deletion of Foxc2 in lymphatic vessels has been shown to lead to downregulation of the cLEC marker Ackr4, but also to mislocation of surrounding smooth muscle cells 36. cLECs interact physically with the relatively rigid capsule that surrounds LNs. The capsule is a dense network of connective tissue and hence is a unique extracellular matrix ECM, distinct from other parts of the LN 4. Reflecting this, cLECs are highly enriched for genes encoding ECM proteins, Multimerin protein 1 and 2 Mmrn1 and Mmrn2, together with high levels of Platelet-derived growth factor a and b Pdgfa and Pdgfb, Jagged-1 Jag1 a ligand for Notch receptors on both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and Endothelin 1 Edn1 a vasoactive peptide and known lymphatic constrictor, proteins known to maintain interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells 37, 38 and Figure S4. The capsule was recently shown to have a CD34 stromal cell subset with expression of CD248 6, a ligand for MMRN2. MMRN2 can also interact with cLEC expressed MMRN2-ligand Cd93, which was recently coupled to ECM fibrillogenesis in tumor blood endothelium 39. cLECs express the BMP family members Growth differentiation factor 10 Gdf10 and the Bone morphogenic protein 4 Bmp4, which differentiate cLECs from fLECs as well as bridging cells in the SCS and Figures S4, S5. fLEC instead express Bmp2 and Figures S4, S5. The expression of BMPs may mediate both autocrine and paracrine signaling to the surrounding stromal and immune cells. fLECs: An Immune-Active Subset fLECs are the gatekeeper for lymph-derived immune cell entry into the lymph node parenchyma. In keeping with this role, fLECs are characterized by genes involved in immune cell adhesion including Madcam1, Icam1, Vcam1, and Glycam1, supporting active immune cell migration Figures 1D, 5B and Figure S4. These adhesion receptors may also help retain the closely associated SCS macrophages 17. fLECs are also enriched for chemokines, including the known fLEC marker Ccl20 CCR6 ligand 15, 27 but also Cxcl1 CXCR2 ligand Figures 1D, 5B and Figure S4. CCL20 has been linked to innate lymphoid cell ILC trafficking across the SCS 15 and may affect the cross-talk between CCR6-positive DCs and LECs in antigen presentation 40. CCL20 could also influence B cell homeostasis, as memory B cell precursors are distinguished by high CCR6 expression in lymphoid organs of both mouse and man 41 and are closely associated to the SCS 42. CXCL1 may instead contribute to neutrophil migration and recruitment 43. fLECs and Marco-LECs, both macrophage-rich niches 17, share high expression of Csf1 and Figure S4, and fLECs express Platelet factor 4 Pf4 also known as CXCL4 and Figure S4. CSF-1 and CXCL4 both regulate monocyte and macrophage functions 18, 44 and LEC-derived CSF-1 is required to maintain the LN macrophage niches 18. As mentioned earlier, Bmp2 is specifically expressed by fLECs and Figures S4, S5 that are also enriched for both Smad1 and Smad4 and Figure S4 suggesting a role for BMP-signaling in fLEC homeostasis. Another distinguishing feature of fLECs is their expression of CD74 and Figure S4, the MHC class II-associated invariant chain. CD74 is involved in the formation and transport of MHC class II-antigen complexes 45. Together with high levels of H2-Ab1 and Figure S4, this supports a major role of this subset in LN LEC-mediated antigen presentation. Together with the high expression of PD-L1 Cd274 in fLECs Figures 2, 5B and Figure S4, and given that antigens are continuously transported from afferent lymphatics into the SCS, this places the fLECs as the major niche for LN LEC-mediated tolerance. In contrast to all other subsets, fLECs and tzLECs lacks detectable expression of the scavenger receptor Stabilin 2 Stab2, a sinusoidal endothelial marker 46, and have low expression of the tight junction protein Claudin 5 Cldn5 and Figures S4, S6. The latter suggests that junctional properties of the fLECs differ compared to other LN LECs and may reflect requirements for the active immune migration at this site. Marco-LECs: MARCO Medullary Sinus LECs Immunofluorescence staining for MARCO in mouse inguinal LN shows that it delineates the medullary sinuses adjacent to the B cell follicles in the LN cortex perifollicular sinuses. MARCO expression coincides with PD-L1 expression in the medullary sinuses, and is excluded from the PD-L1 negative medullary sinuses closest to the hilus and Figure S2. Lymph from SCS passes through this lymphatic meshwork, abundant in macrophages that can capture lymph-borne pathogens 17, 47. While MARCO is also marker for medullary macrophages 47, a major part of the MARCO expression within the adult LN is however confined to LECs. MARCO expression is also abundant in human LN medullary sinuses 27, 34. In macrophages, MARCO expression facilitates phagocytic clearance by binding both gram-negative and positive bacteria 48, but its function in LECs is not known. Marco-LECs also express the C-type lectin Clec1b CLEC2 and Figure S4, a ligand for podoplanin PDPN. CLEC2 is also expressed by myeloid cells, including DCs 49, and interaction between PDPN fibroblastic reticular cells FRCs and CLEC2 DCs has been implicated in FRC contractility and LN expansion in inflammation 49, 50. LN LEC-expressed CLEC2 may mediate both homotypic and heterotypic cell interactions, since PDPN is highly expressed by LECs and by surrounding FRCs. Stab2 is highly expressed by Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs Figure S6, and together with Ptx3-LECs they are also enriched for the coagulation factor VIII F8 and Figure S4. We previously showed that LN LECs are a major source of FVIII production 51. The present result shows that F8 along with Stab2 are features of medullary LEC subsets. Their co-expression may be a general feature of sinusoidal EC, since both are also characteristic of hepatic sinusoidal endothelium. FVIII forms a complex with von Willebrand factor vWF in plasma, a complex that is cleared by STAB2-expressing liver sinusoidal blood endothelial cells in a vWF-dependent manner 52. However, the very low expression of vWF by mouse LN LECs 51 and data not shown suggests that FVIII may function as a pro-coagulant factor independent of vWF, possibly promoting the formation of fibrin mesh to block the spread of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus in the medulla 53. The results show that Marco-LECs share gene expression patterns with myeloid cells, suggesting that this LEC subpopulation has a major role in innate immune functions. Interestingly, Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs express higher levels of Kdr, encoding VEGFR2, than other LN subsets and Figure S4, which is discussed in further detail below. Ptx3-LECs: Ptx3 Central Medulla and Paracortical Sinus LECs Marco and Pd-l1 Cd274 Ptx3-LECs uniquely express Pentraxin-3 Ptx3 and. They are also distinguished by expression of Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor 5 Itih5, Mannose receptor C-type 1 Mrc1, Reelin Reln and a relative enrichment in Lyve1 and Stab2 and Figure S4 and Ccl21a, in C57BL6 mice. PTX3 belongs to the pentraxin family: secreted proteins with a cyclic and multimeric structure 54. They bind pathogens and damaged self-proteins, acting as soluble pattern recognition molecules that mediate activation of complement and promote phagocytosis 54. Medullary sinuses also support sustained and close interactions with long-lived plasma cells 35 and thus adaptive antibody-based and innate responses are likely to provide complementary defense mechanisms at this site. Ptx3-LECs share gene expression with dermal capillary LECs, with which they share morphologic features. Both have sprout-like blind ends specialized for attracting leukocytes and fluid flow into the lymphatics 4, 55 Figures 2, 3. Ptx3 itself is not expressed by dermal capillary LEC in mouse, but capillary and Ptx3-LECs share Itih5, Mrc1, Ccl21, and Lyve1 5658 and data not shown. CCL21 mediates recruitment of CCR7 dendritic cells DCs and T cells into dermal lymphatic capillaries 58, 59. Although in the peripheral LN Ptx3-LECs analyzed here Ccl21 expression is relatively low compared with levels in candidate collecting vessels in, it is more highly expressed in Ptx3-LEC in mesenteric LN not shown and in the human LN, as discussed below. Thus, CCL21 in Ptx3-LECs may contribute to leukocyte-LEC interactions and egress of CCR7 cells including naïve B and T cells, possibly complementing the known role of sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P in this process 55, 60. Expression of the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 promotes the transmigration of DCs into blind-ended capillary lymphatic vessels 57. MRC-1, a known marker for subsets of macrophages, binds microorganisms and promotes phagocytosis 48. MRC-1 expression in peripheral lymphatic vessels also facilitates interaction with CD44-expressing immune cells 56, and could thus interact with activated CD44high T cells in egress from the LN. Thus, the paracortical and medullary sinus Ptx3-LECs share with peripheral capillary LECs gene programs for LEC-immune cell interactions, and support lymphocyte entry into medullary sinuses and exit from the LN. Ptx3 itself, as well as other genes selective to Ptx3-LECs, have known or proposed roles in the extracellular matrix ECM 54. PTX3 binds collagen and fibrinogen-domain containing proteins, including ECM components, but also other pattern recognition molecules like C1q and ficolins 61; thus, it may amplify innate pathogen recognition mechanisms and contribute to maintenance and repair of the LN medullary environment. The Ptx3-LEC marker Reelin Reln is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. In the periphery, Reelin is associated with the transition of peripheral capillary vessels to collecting vessels and contributes to the cross-talk between collecting vessel and surrounding smooth-muscle cells 62. ITIH5 was originally isolated in a complex with hyaluronan 63 which can stabilize the ECM 64. Notably, Ptx3-LECs also express high levels of the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 and ITIH-proteins have been shown to interact with PTX3 65. This provides a possible functional link between LYVE-1, ITIH5, and PTX3 in the Ptx3-LEC niche. Ptx3-LECs are also enriched for the collagen and integrin-binding ECM protein TGFbeta-induced protein Tgfbi and Figure S4, which is induced in LECs by hypoxia 66. Together with high levels of the ECM protein Mmrn1 and Figure S4, these genes support the notion of a highly specialized medullary ECM. Ptx3-LECs show the highest levels of Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 Vegfr3, or Flt4 67 and of its co-receptor Neuropilin 2 Nrp2 68 and Figure S4, suggesting a higher responsiveness to vascular endothelial growth factor C VEGFC 69, 70. VEGFC is a major driver of lymphangiogenesis in development 69 and in the adult lymphatic vasculature 71. VEGFR2 Kdr, which binds both VEGFC and VEGFA 67, is also highly expressed in Ptx3-LECs, although it is most enriched in Marco-LECs. Thus, VEGFA and VEGFC may elicit niche-specific responses in medullary sinus LECs, acting differently on Vegfr3high Vegfr2intermed Ptx3-LECs and Vegfr3intermedlow Vegfr2high Marco-LECs. Interestingly, while SCS fLEC and cLECs are established in embryogenesis 36, the medullary sinuses form by sprouting during the first two postnatal weeks 72. Thus, high Vegfr3 Flt4 in Ptx3-LEC could reflect retention of their postnatal programs for VEGFC-dependent sprouting 72, and may imbue them with the capacity to regenerate or expand rapidly in response to the requirements of LN inflammatory responses. It is well-established that it is primarily the LYVE-1 medullary and paracortical sinuses that expand in response to inflammation and in tumor draining LNs 73, 74. The Ptx3-LEC marker Angiopoietin 2 Angpt2 has also been linked to LEC proliferation 75, 76: it can induce lymphatic hyperplasia when overexpressed 76 and is highly expressed by newly formed lymphatic vessels in inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis 75. Ptx3-LECs, like cLECs, but in contrast to all other parenchymal LN LEC subsets, also lack expression of PD-L1 Cd274. Loss of PD-L1 is associated with increased LN LEC proliferation but also increased LEC apoptosis after inflammation 25. Thus, low PD-L1 suggest higher responsiveness not only to proliferation-inducing signals but also higher sensitivity to apoptotic cell death, the latter thought to facilitate LN contraction after inflammatory stimuli 25. Taken together, high Vegfr3, Vegfr2, Nrp2, Angpt2, and low Cd274 PD-L1 suggest a major role of Ptx3-LECs in LN remodeling. A Cellular Bridge Between the SCS Ceiling and Floor As discussed earlier, trajectory analysis not only predicts a transitional population, tzLECs, that link fLEC and Marco-LEC, but further identifies a bridge population that connects cLEC and fLEC. This bridge population is variably represented in the mouse samples and Figure S1A but is prominent in the human see below,. We plotted gene expression of cells along the path from cLEC to fLEC Figure S5 and Figure S7A and found that individual cells within the bridge display variable levels of cLEC and fLEC marker transcripts including Lyve1 Figure S7A, but overall a decreasing gradient of cLEC markers e.g., Ackr4 and Cav1 and an increasing gradient of fLEC markers Madcam1, Pd-l1Cd274 in the progression from cLEC to fLEC Figure S7A. We speculate that these cells participate in formation of previously described transendothelial channels, physical bridges that link the subcapsular ceiling and floor 10, 12, 36. Immunofluorescence imaging indicate that these cords consist not only of channels 10, 36, but also nucleated LECs traversing the sinus, as indicated by nuclear staining for the lymphatic reporter Prox1-GFP Figure S7B. We used immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization for RNA RNAscope to evaluate bridge cell expression of cLEC and fLEC markers Figure S7 and Figure S5. Most bridging cells displayed defining phenotypes of cLEC LYVE-1, PD-L1, MAdCAM-1 or fLEC LYVE-1, PD-L1, MAdCAM-1 on the protein level. Cells co-expressing these cLEC and fLEC markers as predicted for cells of the computationally defined bridge were rare or absent Figure S7. However, RNAscope revealed that bridging cells lack mRNA for Bmp4 cLEC marker and have intermediate expression of Bmp2 fLEC marker, a pattern consistent with the single cell profiles of the predicted bridge Figure S5. Although this observation provides some support for the correspondence between the physical and trajectory-inferred cellular bridges, they are far from being conclusive. An alternative possibility is that fLEC and cLEC can interconvert in response to local environmental signals, and that the transcription profiles of these bridge cells are snapshots of cells in process of these transitions. Further experiments are required to map the computationally defined bridge cells within the LN lymphatic network and to confidently identify the profiles of the in situ cellular links between SCS floor and ceiling. Niche-Specific Inflammatory Responses in LN LECs Oxazolone Oxa is a chemical compound used in a prototypical model for inflammation-induced LN hypertrophy 73. We here chose to look at initial LEC responses 48 h after topical skin application of Oxa, before any major lymphangiogenic responses are expected. Lymphangiogenesis is a late effect in LN remodeling, peaking at 57 days after Oxa, or other inflammatory stimuli 25, 73, 77. We aligned LEC of the Oxa-treated mouse with the untreated control of the same genetic background and observed two new subsets, termed Ox1 and Ox2, in the immunized group.. Niche-specific inflammatory responses in LN LECs. A tUMAP UMAP on trajectory distances of LEC from Oxa-treated and control mice, colored by subsets, including the two additional subsets Ox1 and Ox2 in the Oxa-treated group left. tPC principal components on trajectory distances of LEC from Oxa-treated and control mice, highlighting Ox1 red and Ox2 blue respectively right. B Pairwise Pearson correlation of LEC subsets in Oxa-treated group, calculated using the subset mean expression of the top 1,000 variable genes. C Venn diagrams of DEGs from Ox1 in Oxa-treated LNs compared with fLEC in control LNs, and from Ox2 in Oxa-treated LNs compared with Ptx3-LEC in control LNs upper; p  0.01, fold change  1.2. Heatmaps of 50 select upregulated or downregulated DEGs, with ribosomal genes excluded from the downregulated panel lower; row scaled. D Select GO terms and BioPlanet pathways from Enrichr analysis of DEGs. Inspection of the tSpace projections tUMAP UMAP on trajectory distances and tPC principal components of trajectory distances suggests that Ox1 arises from fLECs, and Ox2 from Ptx3-LECs. Pairwise Pearson correlation based on the top 1,000 variable genes confirmed that Ox1 is most correlated with fLECs Pearson correlation coefficient  0.97 and Ox2 with Ptx3-LECs Pearson correlation coefficient  0.92. We asked which genes were differentially expressed in Ox1 and Ox2 due to Oxa treatment. Compared to fLEC and Ptx3-LEC in untreated LN, respectively, we found that both Ox1 and Ox2 displayed typical interferon IFN responses, with dramatic induction of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 as well as Irf7, the master regulator of type-I IFN-dependent immune responses 78. CXCL9 and CXCL10 bind CXCR3, which mediates recruitment of dendritic cells, NK cells, effector T-cells 79 and, in inflamed LNs, subsets of monocytes 80. Both Ox1 and Ox2 also showed upregulated Psme2, a proteosomal component involved in peptide processing for class I antigen presentation 81. While most gene changes were shared, some were preferentially or more dramatically increased in one or the other subset. Ccl20, which is selectively expressed by fLEC in resting LNs, is highly upregulated in Ox1 but not Ox2, maintaining its selective pattern of expression in the SCS floor Figures 1D, 5B, 6C. Ox1 also displays selective upregulation of Ubiquitin D Ubd, important in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B 82. Oxa controls subset-specific upregulation of monocyte chemoattractants Ccl2 Ox2 and Ccl5 Ox1. CCL5 acts through CCR5, which is expressed by multiple adaptive and innate immune subsets; while CCL2 acts through CCR2 in monocyte recruitment 43. Thus, chemotactic regulations in the SCS and medulla diverge. Gene enrichment analysis confirms Ox1 and Ox2 share enrichment in interferon signaling and immune system signatures, but the subsets also display unique ontologies: e.g., Transforming Growth Factor TGF-beta regulation of ECM in Ox1 and response to Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF in Ox2. Several of the observed changes, including induction of Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl20, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10 were observed previously in analyses of bulk LN LECs in response to HSV-1 virus 77 or after ovalbumin specific T-cell responses 11. Our results link inflammation-induced transcriptional changes to specific LEC subsets, implying that niche-specific changes coordinate LEC-driven responses in early inflammation. Interestingly, in both Ox1 and Ox2, significantly more genes are downregulated than upregulated. Pathway analysis shows downregulation of genes associated with viral gene expression, ribosomes and mRNA processing. This may be a result of the activation of type I interferon signaling, which can cause widespread downregulation of host and viral transcriptional and translational pathways as a defense against viral replication 83, 84. Downregulated genes include Csf1 and Ltb, which is interesting from the perspective of the known transient loss of sinusoidal LN macrophages in acute inflammation 18, 19. Core lymphatic endothelial differentiation genes are also downregulated, including Lyve1 and Cldn5, and subset marker genes are inhibited as well. Ox1 shows reduced expression of fLEC marker genes Cd74 and Bmp2, and Ox2 of Ptx3-LEC marker genes including Stab2 and Tgfbi. In addition to IFN-induced transcriptional repression, another contributing factor may be transcription factor availability, which can dictate level of gene expression 85: TNF-induced RELA-dependent pathways, which are also induced as part of the Oxa response, have been shown to redirect cofactors from super-enhancers, repressing cell identity genes in a cell type dependent manner 86. LEC Phenotypes in Human and Mouse LNs Common Mouse and Human LN LEC Phenotypes We have previously reported LEC diversity and described multiple LEC subsets in human LNs 27. Here we compare our mouse LEC samples to a representative sample of human head and neck LN LECs, selected for its quality, high cell number, and inclusion of each of the subsets we identified. We translated human gene names to their mouse homologs, and integrated human and mouse LECs using Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA 87, which implements a variant of the mutual nearest neighbor algorithm MNN 88. Cross mapping successfully aligned human and mouse LECs, and unsupervised clustering of the aligned cells identified shared but also unique subsets in human LN. The five subsets common to mouse and human cLEC, fLEC, Ptx3-LEC, valve-LEC, and Marco-LEC display high correspondence with human LEC subsets defined previously using unsupervised clustering 27 LEC I, II, IV, V, and VI, respectively. Specifically, the Marco-LEC subset of medullary EC maps to human LEC VI, which we previously characterized as medullary sinus CD209 LECs 27. However, mouse Ptx3-LECs map to human LEC IV, which we postulated to be peripheral capillary LECs 27. We discuss this below.. Cross-mapping of mouse and human LNs reveals conserved LEC populations and additional human cLEC subsets. A UMAP of aligned mouse and human LEC, colored by integrated mouse and human LEC subset left and middle, or human LEC ID as in 27 right. Bridge cells are not shown. B Pairwise overlap scores of top 100 subset-specific DEGs for mouse and human LEC. Overlap score is defined as the ratio between the number of shared genes observed and the number of genes expected to be shared by chance. C Correlation of gene profiles of human LEC subsets. Color scale: pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient, calculated using the mean expression of the top 1000 variable genes left. Expression of cLEC subset-specific genes, projected on UMAP plot of human LN LECs right. D Select pathways from Enrichr analysis of DEGs common to mouse and human. Specialization of the Human SCS Ceiling Unsupervised clustering aligned the mouse cLECs with one subset of the human cLECs, core cLECs, which we identified previously as LEC I 27, but additional cLEC subsets cLEC s1, s2, and s3 were unique to the analyzed human LN. Pearson correlation analysis reveals similarity of these subsets with the core cLECs. cLEC s3 is most similar to the core cLEC population as indicated by correlation and hierarchical clustering, UMAP, and differentially expressed genes DEGs data not shown: we do not discuss this subset further. cLEC s1 corresponds to MFAP4 SCS LEC LEC III, which we located overlying the human LN medulla 27. Consistent with this, cLEC s1 clusters close to Ptx3-LECs, and links other cLECs to Ptx3-LECs in trajectory space see below. cLEC s2, which we did not segregate previously, uniquely expresses high levels of Hairyenhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein HEY1, the chemokine CCL2, and E-Selectin SELE data not shown, suggestive of an activated state. Both E-selectin and CCL2 are induced by inflammation in endothelial cells and regulate leukocyte recruitment 89. Based on HEY1 and SELE expression, the subset is identifiable in 3 of the 6 human LN samples we studied previously 27 data not shown. The findings suggest greater heterogeneity and specialization in SCS ceiling LEC in humans than in the resting specific-pathogen-free SPF mice studied here. The subset specialization of human cLEC may relate to local differences in immune environments, or to the more complex architecture of the human LN. Unlike the mouse, human cLECs participate in invaginations of the capsule, known as trabecular sinuses 4, which may experience more turbulent flow of the incoming lymph and hence variation in shear stress. Comparisons of Human and Mouse LEC Differentially Expressed Genes DEG To evaluate similarities between species, we compared DEGs of mouse and human LEC subsets using a gene overlap score, defined as the ratio of the number of shared DEGs to the number of genes expected to be shared based on random chance, for each combination of mouse and human subsets. In all instances, the highest overlap scores are seen between corresponding subsets. Based on overlap scores, cLECs are more conserved than the more immunologically active subsets fLECs, Marco-LECs, and Ptx3-LECs. The floor and medullary sinus subsets showed less conserved DEG profiles, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure in response to pathogens, contrasting with conservation of structural functions of cLECs. Gene set enrichment analysis based on conserved genes has the potential to highlight core functions of the LEC subsets. Shared cLEC genes are involved in focal adhesion, fluid shear stress response and ECM interaction, consistent with their structural role and association to the capsule. Ptx3-LECs are enriched in genes for endocytosis and lysosome, which could relate to the high expression of scavenger receptors e.g., Lyve1, Stab1, Stab2. Marco-LECs are enriched for lysosomal genes, and for genes of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway as well as the coagulation and complement cascades. fLECs display high enrichment for inflammatory pathways, including JAK-STAT and Nuclear Factor NF-kappa B, and are enriched for genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, supporting their immunomodulatory properties. A number of mouse key subset specific marker DEGs are shared in the human, including fLECs: Bmp2, Ccl20, Cd74, and Csf1; cLECs: Ackr4, Bmp4, and Cav1; Marco-LECs: Marco, Clec4g, and C2; and Ptx3-LECs: Ptx3, Nrp2, and Flt4 Vegfr3. We illustrate expression of these and other select shared marker genes in.. Conserved gene programs for mouse and human LEC specialization. Expression of select gene homologs or paralogs Itih5 and ITIH3 in cLECs, fLECs, Ptx3-LECs, Marco-LECs and valve LECs. Color indicates subset mean log transcript count, normalized within each subset. Dot size indicates subset mean log transcript count, scaled to the maximum value for each gene. As noted above, mouse Marco-LECs align with LEC VI, which we identified previously as the major medullary sinus subset in human LNs 27. Unexpectedly, mouse Ptx3-LECs align with a subset LEC IV that we previously related to capillary LECs based on their enrichment for expression of Ccl21 and Lyve1 27, gene markers of peripheral capillary lymphatic vessels 57, 58. However, these genes are also expressed by mouse Ptx3-LECs Figures 1D, 5B, 8, and as noted earlier, their expression likely reflects the parallels with capillary LEC in morphology blind ends, loose EC junctions and function recruiting fluid and lymphocytes into lymph 4. Supporting a medullary identity, Ptx3-LECs and LEC IV share high levels the sinusoidal endothelial marker Stab2STAB2 46, shown to be expressed by medullary sinuses in human LNs 90. Importantly, human Ptx3-LECs LEC IV also share expression of PTX3 and lack PD-L1 CD274 expression, similar to their mouse counterpart; and they express the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor gene family member ITIH3, functionally related to the mouse Ptx3-LEC marker Itih5 64. Ptx3-LECs in both humans and mice are distinguished from Marco-LECs by higher expression of the glycoprotein and scavenger receptor CD36, also known as Fatty Acid Translocase FAT. Staining of CD36 in human head and neck LNs identified capillary-like, CD36high LYVE-1 lymphatic cords, negative for MARCO and the Marco-LEC LEC VI 27 marker CLEC4M Figures 9B,C. These CD36high lymphatic sinuses were found either as isolated cords in the paracortex Figures 9B,C or as extended sprouts from MARCO CLEC4M medullary sinuses, similar to mouse Ptx3-LECs which connects to Marco-LECs in perifollicular regions. Human Ptx3-LECs are also distinguished from Marco-LECs by high expression of PDPN and CCL21, as predicted by the transcriptional profiles Figure S8, while both medullary subsets express LYVE-1 and STAB2 Figure S8. Thus, cross-species comparison of single-cell profiles and in situ analysis support that human and mouse share two distinct niches of paracortical and medullary sinus LECs: MARCO LECs, which correspond to the previously published CD209 medullary sinus LEC subset LEC VI 27, and Ptx3-LECs, PDPNhigh, CD36high paracortical and medullary sinus LECs, corresponding to LEC IV 27 in our earlier classification of human LN LECs. Notably, human and mouse LN LECs also share the in situ physical transition between Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs, as predicted in trajectory analysis Figures 1C, 10A, discussed below..

B Expression pattern of indicated genes. Marco-LEC, Ptx3-LEC, and cLEC s1 populations are highlighted. Values are batch-corrected imputed log counts. Species-Specific Gene Expression A number of genes with homologs in mouse and human are not conserved in expression, or display different patterns of subset selectivity. Here we highlight select examples for discussion Figure S9. As noted earlier, the mouse fLEC markers Madcam1 and Msr1 are poorly expressed by human LECs 27 data not shown. ACKR1, also known as DARC Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines, marks human fLECs and Marco-LECs, but Ackr1 has very low expression in mouse LN LECs, without clear subset selectivity Figure S9B. Consistent with this, endothelial ACKR1 in mouse is restricted to venular blood vessels, with only sparse and low detection in LECs 91. ACKR1 is a chemokine interceptor, which can serve as a sink for a large range of inflammatory chemokines 92. Its expression could reflect a greater need to moderate inflammatory chemokines in the human. Alternatively, it may facilitate transport of chemokines across the lymphatic endothelium in the human LN, as ACKR1 has been shown to shuttle chemokines across endothelial cell layers 93. Several ACKR1 ligands are expressed by human fLECs including CXCL3 and CXCL5 27. Human but not mouse LN LECs also display high expression of IL6 in fLECs Figure S9B, likely reflecting a higher inflammatory basal state in human, especially compared to our SPF mice. Human Ptx3-LECs express MMP2 and LOX, genes missing in mouse LECs or expressed in different subsets i.e., Lox expressed weakly in cLECs in mouse Figure S9B. Both Matrix metalloproteinase 2 MMP2 and Lysyl oxidase LOX can contribute to ECM modulation 94, 95, suggesting that, although matrix interplay is conserved, the specific mechanisms of matrix interaction in this population of LECs may have diverged. Mouse-specific LN LEC DEGs include Apolipoprotein E ApoE in cLECs and medullary sinus populations and Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 Rgs4 in fLECs Figure S9B. Carboxypeptidase E Cpe and Carbonic anhydrase 8 Car8 are examples of genes with different expression pattern across mouse and mouse LN LEC subsets Figure S9B. Since scRNA-seq is often unable to detect low abundance transcripts, the apparent lack of expression of a gene must be interpreted with caution: the expression pattern of the genes mentioned here have been observed in each of our samples. In addition, CD209 and CLEC4M, which lack orthologs in mouse 27, are specific for human Marco-LECs. We described them previously as medullary sinus markers 27. Human IL32 and mouse Glycam1 also lack orthologs. IL-32 potently amplifies inflammatory responses by induction of multiple cytokines 96; it is highly expressed by human Ptx3-LECs data not shown. GLYCAM1, a secreted mucin that on high endothelial venules is decorated with glycotopes for leukocyte selectins 97, is selectively expressed by mouse fLEC and Figure S4. The Continuum of Human LEC Phenotypes in Trajectory Space We have focused to this point on comparing subsets of human and mouse LECs, but as illustrated for the mouse, LECs exist in a phenotypic continuum that may reflect physical alignments spatial transitions, developmental sequences, or both. To gain further insight into LEC diversity and zonation within human LNs, we ran tSpace on combined LN LECs from our six previously published human samples 27. In the tSpace projections in, cell identities are determined based on correlation with the core subsets in our index human LN left or based on unsupervised clustering as previously 27 right. Alignment of human LECs in trajectory space reveals both similarities and differences to the mouse. Shared subsets are aligned in the same order as in the mouse, with links from Valve-LECs to cLECs, Ptx3-LECs, Marco-LECs and finally fLECs compare with mouse alignments in Figures 1B,C. However, in the human, the cellular bridge between cLECs and fLECs is highly populated with cells. The human-specific cLEC subsets also show interesting alignments. cLEC s2 appears closely linked to the bridge. cLEC s1, which we previously identified as SCS ceiling LEC overlying the medulla LEC III 27, extends toward and links prominently to Ptx3-LECs see arrows: Cells from both subsets within this Ptx3-LECs-to-cLEC s1 trajectory express PTX3 itself, and are highly enriched in CCL21, suggesting a relationship of PTX3 medullary sinuses and the perihilar ceiling. Supporting this notion, RNAscope of a neonatal human LN showed extensive PTX3 in the medulla of the hilar region data not shown. Co-expression of CCL21 and SPHK1 enzyme required for S1P production support a role of Ptx3-LECs in lymphocyte egress. Heterogeneity in ANGPT2 also exists along the Ptx3-LEC paths. The alignments outlined here are not an artifact of the high cell number or integration of LEC from different LNs, because the same patterns and linkages are seen in independent tSpace projections of our index LN sample not shown. Human LN LECs thus display numerous intermediate phenotypes and complex zonation that may reflect the complexity of human LN architecture observed histologically. Summary and Outlook The LN lymphatic vasculature provides a complex lymphatic vascular bed, adapted to a unique microenvironment where cooperation between stromal cells and immune cells forms the basis for effective immune cell interaction and activation. Endothelial cells in this environment not only need to provide a framework for the structural organization of the organ, but also need to be able to adapt to constant changes induced by immunological stimuli and organ expansion in LN hypertrophy, and to support tolerogenic immune reactions in homeostasis. We define five LN LEC subsets in mouse: valve LECs, the SCS Ackr4 cLECs, the immune active Ccl20 fLECs, as well as Ptx3-LECs and Marco-LECs, two paracortical and medullary sinus subsets that were not recognized previously. Single-cell gene profiles indicate niche-specific functional specialization of these subsets with distinct pathways for pathogen interactions and matrix modeling. Interestingly, cross-species mapping with human LN LECs shows that both subsets as well as their respective functions are conserved, which allows us to redefine the subset previously identified as candidate capillary LECs LEC IV 27 in human LN to paracortical sinus Ptx3-LECs. PTX3 and MARCO, gene markers chosen here to designate the two distinct medullary LEC subsets, are conserved both in their expression patterns among LEC subsets and also in protein sequence between humans and mice 92 homology PTX3 and 69 MARCO, suggesting that they may have conserved functions as well. Recently developed algorithms have made important advances in solving the complex problem of integrating different datasets 8799. As shown here, they not only perform well in combining sample replicates by removing batch effects, but can also identify and map similar subsets of cells across species barriers. Mutual nearest neighbors and CCA algorithms not only mapped human LEC subsets to mouse counterparts, but also uncovered species-specific LN LEC subset compositions, revealing a greater diversity of SCS ceiling LEC in human. We can look forward to continuing advances in computational approaches to integrating and mining scRNA-seq data. Particularly exciting is the power of trajectory inference to recapitulate or predict the organization of endothelial cells within the complex vascular networks. While trajectory analysis has been shown to model sequences of cell phenotypes in development pseudotime 30, our results both in lymphatics here and blood vascular EC studies 31 show that computed alignments of cells in trajectory space reflect the tissue architecture spatial organization and physical relationships between endothelial cells in situ with surprising faithfulness. This correspondence implies, as an approximation, that endothelial cell phenotypes progress in a gradual and orderly fashion within the linear arrangements as in vascular tubes or sheets as in the SCS and sinus-lining LECs in the LN that make up the endothelium. In essence, trajectories provide a computational roadmap for mapping gene expression to the vascular endothelium. The results underscore the diversity of endothelial cells as a continuum, punctuated by concentrations of particular phenotypes or niches that are identified as subsets. Whether the progression of phenotypes and zonation among LN LECs reflects malleable LEC responses to local niche factors, retention of a programmed developmental response, or both, remains to be determined. Our studies here demonstrate the power of single-cell profiling to illuminate the biology of the vascular endothelium, and the promise it holds to revolutionize our understanding of conserved and species-specific regulation of the vasculature and its responses in physiology and human disease. Materials and Methods Mice Male and female 68-week-old BALBcJ or 812-week-old C57BL6J peripheral LNs inguinal, axillary and brachial processed by 10x Genomics workflow, or 20-week-old Prox1-GFPC57BL6J 33 female inguinal LNs processed by SMART-seq2 workflow were used for scRNA-seq. Mice were bred and maintained in the animal facilities at Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal. In addition, mice were held at a Specific Pathogen Free SPF facility Uppsala University, and experimental procedures were approved by the local animal ethics committee at the Uppsala County Court 600917. Immune Challenge BALBcJ mice were subjected to cutaneous Oxazolone Oxa challenge by applying 5 4-Ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one Sigma-Aldrich in acetone and olive oil topical to the skin as described 73. Axillary, brachial, and inguinal draining LNs were harvested 48 h after immunization. Tissue Dissociation and Single-Cell Library Preparation Cell isolation for 10x: Single-cell suspensions of total EC were generated as previously described 100. For each group, axillary, inguinal, and brachial LNs from 25 to 30 male and female BALBcJ or C57BL6J mice were combined, minced, washed with Hanks Balanced Salt solution, and dissociated for 30 min at 37C with gentle rocking in HBSS with calcium and magnesium medium containing 0.2 mgml Collagenase P, 0.8 mgml Dispase II, and 0.01 mgml DNase I Sigma-Aldrich adapted from 14. Hematopoietic cells were depleted with anti-CD45 mouse MicroBeads according to the manufacturers protocol Miltenyi and the remaining cells were stained with anti-CD31 BV605 clone 390 and anti-PDPN PE-Cy7 clone 8.1.1 antibodies, as well as dump antibodies consisting of anti-CD45 clone 30-F11, anti-EpCAM clone G8.8, anti-TER119 clone TER-119, anti-CD11a clone H155-78, and anti-CD11b clone M170 in PerCP-Cy5.5. Total EC lin CD31 were sorted into 100 fetal bovine serum using FACS Aria III BD Biosciences; 100 um nozzle; 2,500 cellss, washed, and immediately processed to generate scRNA-seq library using Chromium Single Cell 3 Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 10x Genomics according to manufacturers instructions. Libraries were sequenced with NextSeq 500 Illumina using 150 cycles high output V2 kit Read 1: 26 bp, Read 2: 98 bp at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility. Cell isolation for SMART-seq2: Inguinal LN digests from Prox1-GFP mice 33, depleted for hematopoietic cells as described above, were stained with anti-CD31 PE-Cy7 clone 390, anti-PDPN AF660 clone eBio8.11 antibodies Thermo Fisher Scientific. Dump channel included anti-mouse TER-119 eFluor450 clone Ter119, anti-mouse CD45 eFluor450 clone 30-F11, anti-mouse CD11b eFluor450 clone M170, and dead cell staining SYTOX Blue Thermo Fisher Scientific. Triple positive live cells GFP PDPN CD31 LECs were gated and sorted on a BD FACSAria III BD Biosciences 100 um nozzle, 20 psi as single cells into a 384 well plate with lysis buffer. Single cell libraries were prepared as described and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 101. Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Analysis 10x Genomics: Read alignment and quality control were performed using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v3.0.2 and the mm10 reference genome. Loupe Cell Browser v3.1.1; 10x Genomics was used to manually gate on LEC Pdpn CD31 for downstream analysis. SMART-seq2: After lane demultiplexing, SMART-seq2 based FASTQ files were trimmed with Trim Galore v0.4.4 followed by alignment of the data to the mouse reference genome mm10-GRCm38 using TopHat v2.1.1 and bowtie2 v2.2.6.0. PCR duplicates were removed using SAMtools v0.1.18. Counting of fragments aligning per gene was done using the featurecounts function of the Subread package v1.4.6-p5. Count data were processed with the Seurat package v3.1.0 87, 99. For quality control, genes that were expressed in fewer than three cells and cells that expressed fewer than 100 genes were excluded from analysis. Raw counts were log normalized, and 2000 most variable genes were identified based on a variance stabilizing transformation. To correct for batch differences, variable gene sets were used to align multiple datasets for joint analysis, using the Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA method within the FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions of the Seurat package, which implements a variant of the mutual nearest neighbors MNN algorithm. Correspondences between single cells across datasets were identified and multiple datasets were transformed into a shared space. Principal Component Analysis PCA dimensionality reduction was performed using the variable gene sets. Cell clusters were determined using a Shared Nearest Neighbor SNN modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm of the Seurat FindClusters function, and were visualized with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding tSNE 102 or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP 103. Contaminating pericyte, immune and blood endothelial cells were removed by supervised gating on the tSNE plot. To recover gene-gene relationships that are lost due to dropouts, we imputed missing gene expression data from log normalized count data using an in-house customization https:github.comkbruloismagicBatch of the MAGIC Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells algorithm with optimized parameters t  2, k  9, ka  3 104. Imputed data were used for visualization of single-cell gene expression in violin plots and heatmaps 105, as well as for trajectory analyses. Nearest Neighbor Alignments in Trajectory Space tSpace was used to model the nearest neighbor relationships as well as transitional zones between LEC subsets 30. Mapping of cells in trajectory space allows unsupervised reconstruction and exploration of complex developmental sequences, without implementation of cell clustering or manifold distortion for graphical expedience. Batch effects were removed using the fastMNN function of the batchelor package v1.0.1 88 and variable genes were identified using the scran package 106. For mouse LEC, we used tSpace with default parameters T  100, K  20, 5 graphs, 20 way points, Euclidean distance metric and imputed expression values of the top 800 variable genes Figures 1C, 6A, right panel or batch-corrected low-dimensional coordinates top 50 coordinates, left panel. The trajectory matrices were visualized in low dimensional space using PCA Figures 1C, 6A, right panel or UMAP, left panel within the tSpace package. For combined human LEC samples, imputed data of LEC from 6 LNs were batch-corrected as above. Twenty PCs from the 1000 variable genes were calculated, the loadings were adjusted to a minimum value of 0 by addition of a constant and used as input to the tSpace algorithm T  200, K  25, 5 graphs, 10-way points, cosine distance metric. Differential Gene Expression and Gene Enrichment Analysis Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the negative binomial generalized linear model within the FindMarkers function of Seurat on log normalized count data p  0.01, fold change  1.2. To identify subset-defining genes, single-cell transcriptomes of cells in the subset of interest were compared to those of all other cells within the same sample. Only upregulated DEGs were considered, unless otherwise specified. Gene enrichment analysis of DEGs with Gene Ontology 107, 108, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 109, 110, and BioPlanet 111 databases was performed using Enrichr 112, 113. Correlation Analysis To determine similarities between LEC subsets, mean gene expression values were calculated for each subset. The top 1000 most variable genes across all subsets were used for pairwise Pearson correlation analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the average linkage method. Cross Species Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Human HNLN1 dataset GSE124494 27 was used for the integrated LEC profiling. Human gene names were converted to their mouse homologs using the biomaRt package v2.40.4 114. scRNA-seq datasets were integrated in Seurat for unsupervised clustering. The top 100 most upregulated DEGs for each subset, as ranked by the fold change of gene expression in the subset relative to other LEC combined, were determined for human LEC and separately for mouse. An overlap score was defined as the number of DEGs common to one human subset and one mouse subset divided by the number of genes expected to be shared by the two subsets by chance. For each pair of mouse subset and human subsets, overlap score  n  A  B  N, where n  number of observed overlapping genes between the top 100 DEGs of the human subset and the mouse subset, A  number of DEGs considered in the mouse subset 100, B  number of DEGs considered in the human subset with mouse homologs, and N  total number of genes detected in both mouse and human LEC, 13,458. Reanalysis of Human LEC Datasets For the combined analysis of human LEC samples 27, imputed gene expression data were batch-corrected and used for trajectory analysis as above. LEC in each of the additional five human samples were classified by correspondence to the index human subsets that mapped with mouse subsets as follows: reference subset mean gene expression was generated from the index HNLN1 human dataset, using core cells of each major subset that cross-mapped with mouse subsets, as well as manually gated bridge cells that link fLEC and cLEC in tSpace projections. Cells in the other human samples were classified by Pearson correlation using the 1000 most variable genes in the reference set. Immunostaining of Mouse LNs Inguinal and popliteal mouse LNs were harvested from Prox1-GFP mice 33 and fixed in 0.8 paraformaldehyde PFA for 12 h at 4C.

Single-cell transcriptomics promise to revolutionize our understanding of the vasculature. Emerging computational methods applied to high-dimensional single-cell data allow integration of results between samples and species and illuminate the diversity and underlying developmental and architectural organization of cell populations. Here, we illustrate these methods in the analysis of mouse lymph node LN lymphatic endothelial cells LEC at single-cell resolution. Clustering identifies five well-delineated subsets, including two medullary sinus subsets not previously recognized as distinct. Nearest neighbor alignments in trajectory space position the major subsets in a sequence that recapitulates the known features and suggests novel features of LN lymphatic organization, providing a transcriptional map of the lymphatic endothelial niches and of the transitions between them. Differences in gene expression reveal specialized programs for 1 subcapsular ceiling endothelial interactions with the capsule connective tissue and cells; 2 subcapsular floor regulation of lymph borne cell entry into the LN parenchyma and antigen presentation; and 3 pathogen interactions and 4 LN remodeling in distinct medullary subsets. LEC of the subcapsular sinus floor and medulla, which represent major sites of cell entry and exit from the LN parenchyma respectively, respond robustly to oxazolone inflammation challenge with enriched signaling pathways that converge on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Integration of mouse and human single-cell profiles reveals a conserved cross-species pattern of lymphatic vascular niches and gene expression, as well as specialized human subsets and genes unique to each species. The examples provided demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis in elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, vascular organization, and endothelial cell responses. We discuss the findings from the perspective of LEC functions in relation to niche formations in the unique stromal and highly immunological environment of the LN. ORIGINAL RESEARCH article Front.

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \\nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \\nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word. Strictly format like this: \\n<|Context|>the context<|Question|>the content of the question<|Answer|>the content of the answer<|Keyword|>the answer keywords\\n<|Context|>the context<|Question|>the content of the question<|Answer|>the content of the answer<|Keyword|>the answer keywords\\n...\\n\\nManuscript: Human T cells coordinate adaptive immunity in diverse anatomic compartments through production of cytokines and effector molecules, but it is unclear how tissue site influences T cell persistence and function. Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of 50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8 T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4 T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8 compared to CD4 T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease. scRNA-seq analysis of human T cells in blood and tissues We obtained BM, LN, and LG as representative primary lymphoid, secondary lymphoid and mucosal tissue sites, respectively, from two deceased adult organ donors who met the criteria of health for donation of physiologically healthy tissues for lifesaving transplantation, being free of chronic disease and cancer Supplementary Table 1. Human T cells persist in distinct anatomic sites, maintain protective immunity and surveillance, and are key targets for immune modulation in tumor immunotherapy, transplantation, and autoimmunity.\\nDataset: Cell Type: immature alpha-beta T cell, Tissue: lower lobe of left lung, Gene Expression: TMSB4X RPS27 B2M RPL41 RPLP1 RPL10 EEF1A1 RPL13 RPS19 RPL13A RPL34 RPS29 RPLP2 RPL21

The molecular mechanisms that regulate follicular growth and regression, ensuring ovarian tissue homeostasis, remain elusive. We have performed single-cell RNA-sequencing using human adult ovaries to provide a map of the molecular signature of growing and regressing follicular populations. We have identified different types of granulosa and theca cells and detected local production of components of the complement system by atretic theca cells and stromal cells. We also have detected a mixture of adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as several types of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to aid the remodeling process. Our results highlight the relevance of mapping whole adult organs at the single-cell level and reflect ongoing efforts to map the human body. The association between complement system and follicular remodeling may provide key insights in reproductive biology and infertility. Sample preparation from the inner cortex of adult ovary We have analyzed anonymised ovarian tissue inner cortex from adult women N  5 undergoing fertility preservation procedures outer cortex is cryopreserved. Several studies have used single-cell technology to reveal the molecular signatures of fetal24,25 and adult oocytes26,27,28,29,30,31 during human oogenesis.\\nDataset: Cell Type: B cell, Tissue:

Despite extensive research, disease heterogeneity is poorly characterized, hampering efforts for early diagnosis and improved treatments. Here, we apply single cell RNA sequencing to study the heterogeneity of 40 individuals along the multiple myeloma progression spectrum, including 11 healthy controls, demonstrating high interindividual variability that can be explained by expression of known multiple myeloma drivers and additional putative factors. We identify extensive subclonal structures for 10 of 29 individuals with multiple myeloma. In asymptomatic individuals with early disease and in those with minimal residual disease post-treatment, we detect rare tumor plasma cells with molecular characteristics similar to those of active myeloma, with possible implications for personalized therapies. Single cell analysis of rare circulating tumor cells allows for accurate liquid biopsy and detection of malignant plasma cells, which reflect bone marrow disease. Our work establishes single cell RNA sequencing for dissecting blood malignancies and devising detailed molecular characterization of tumor cells in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Individuals with multiple myeloma display unique signatures that converge into common malignant pathways To better understand the heterogeneity within and across individuals with multiple myeloma, we designed a protocol for single cell transcriptomic characterization of the bone marrow plasma cells as well as the circulating plasma cells from individuals with MGUS, SMM, multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. We report on a new methodology for sensitive characterization of the entire spectrum of clinical progression from normal plasma cells to multiple myeloma using scRNA-seq.\\nDataset: Cell Type: T cell,

However, little is known about the cells that make up the human liver and its immune microenvironment. Here we report a map of the cellular landscape of the human liver using single-cell RNA sequencing. We provide the transcriptional profiles of 8444 parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells obtained from the fractionation of fresh hepatic tissue from five human livers. Using gene expression patterns, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical examinations, we identify 20 discrete cell populations of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, B cells, conventional and non-conventional T cells, NK-like cells, and distinct intrahepatic monocytemacrophage populations. Together, our study presents a comprehensive view of the human liver at single-cell resolution that outlines the characteristics of resident cells in the liver, and in particular provides a map of the human hepatic immune microenvironment. A protocol for human liver dissociation for scRNA-seq A central problem in liver tissue dissociation is that hepatocytes and cholangiocytes are sensitive to cell death, and other cells activate, in response to cell manipulation15,16,17. A key problem hindering the study of the human liver is difficulty in accessing fresh tissue.\\nDataset: Cell Type: B cell, Tissue: liver, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-CO2 MT-ND4 RPS27

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \\nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \\nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word. Strictly format like this: \\n<|Context|>the context<|Question|>the content of the question<|Answer|>the content of the answer<|Keyword|>the answer keywords\\n<|Context|>the context<|Question|>the content of the question<|Answer|>the content of the answer<|Keyword|>the answer keywords\\n...\\n\\nManuscript: Fibroblasts are an essential cell population for human skin architecture and function. While fibroblast heterogeneity is well established, this phenomenon has not been analyzed systematically yet. We have used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptomes of more than 5,000 fibroblasts from a sun-protected area in healthy human donors. Our results define four main subpopulations that can be spatially localized and show differential secretory, mesenchymal and pro-inflammatory functional annotations. Importantly, we found that this fibroblast priming becomes reduced with age. We also show that aging causes a substantial reduction in the predicted interactions between dermal fibroblasts and other skin cells, including undifferentiated keratinocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction. Our work thus provides evidence for a functional specialization of human dermal fibroblasts and identifies the partial loss of cellular identity as an important age-related change in the human dermis. These findings have important implications for understanding human skin aging and its associated phenotypes. scRNA-seq analysis of sun-protected human skin The anatomy of the skin can vary considerably depending on a number of endogenous and environmental factors28,29. Single-cell transcriptomics currently represents the most effective method to define cell populations in a given tissue51,52.\\nDataset: Cell Type: T cell, Tissue: zone of skin, Gene Expression:

We constructed a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice on the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 49 transcriptomic cell types, including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. We also analyzed cell typespecific mRNA processing and characterized genetic access to these transcriptomic types by many transgenic Cre lines. Finally, we found that some of our transcriptomic cell types displayed specific and differential electrophysiological and axon projection properties, thereby confirming that the single-cell transcriptomic signatures can be associated with specific cellular properties. Cell-type identification To minimize the potential variability in cell types as a result of differences in cortical region, age and sex, we focused on a single cortical area in adult 8-week-old male mice. The adult mouse visual cortex contains about 1,000,000 cells, of which about half are neurons48 that can be divided into glutamatergic 80 and GABAergic cells 2049.\\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-β signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental.

Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium. Download figureOpen in new tab . Velocity analysis that uncovers two potential progenitor populations. A. B. C. In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005).

Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types.

Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-β mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states–F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\\nDataset: Cell Type: pericyte, Tissue: isthmus of fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TAGLN C11ORF96 EEF1A1 ACTA2 RPLP1 MYL9 TPM2 MT-CO1 RPL10 ADIRF MT-ATP6 MT-CYB VIM RPL41 ACTB MT2A

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-β signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental.

CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium.

In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells.

Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types.

Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-β mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states–F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\\nDataset: Cell Type: secretory cell, Tissue: ampulla of uterine tube, Gene Expression: RPL41 EEF1A1 RPL10 MALAT1 RPL13 RPS12 RPLP1 RPS8 RPS4X TPT1 RPS18 RPL12 RPS14 RPS19 RPS27A RPL34 RPL7A RPL32 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 RPL11 RPS24 RPL26 RPS23 RPS27 RPL30 RPS3A RPL3 RPS3 RPL28 RPS2 RPL29 RPS6 RPL5 MT-ATP6 RPL19 RPL8 RPL10A MT-CYB CLU RPL14 MT-CO2 RPL18 RPL18A RPS28 RPL39 RPL37 RPL35A RPS15 RPL21 RPS9 FTH1 RPS13 RPS15A RPL36 RPLP0 RPL17 MT-ND3 RPL6 ACTG1 RPS25 RPS21 MT-ND4 RPL9 RPS5 RPL37A PTMA RPL15 RPL24 FAU RPS7 RPL13A NACA RPL23A RACK1 RPSA ACTB RPS29 RPS26 RPS16 RPL35 RPL36A H3-3B RPLP2 IFITM3 WFDC2 RPL22 KRT18 EIF1 RPL7 RPS10 HSP90AB1 MT-ND1 JUND EEF1B2 UBC NPM1 GAPDH HSP90AA1 GSTP1\\nCell Type: secretory cell, Tissue: fallopian tube, Gene Expression: OVGP1 RPL41 EEF1A1 RPL10 MALAT1 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 RPL13 MT-CYB RPS12 RPS18 MT-ATP6 RPS8 MT-CO2 RPLP1 TPT1 MT-ND3 RPL12 RPS14 MT-ND4 RPS4X RPS27 RPS2 RPL26 RPL34 RPL7A RPS24 WFDC2 RPL32 RPL28 CLU RPS23 RPS3A RPS27A RPL3 HSP90AA1 RPS19 FTH1 RPL11 RPL17 RPL13A RPL29 RPL30 RPS6 RPS28 RPL15 RPS3 CRISP3 RPL18A RPL19 RPL37 RPL37A RPL39 RPL10A RPL36 PTMA RPL8 RPL18 RPL23A RPS29 RPS9 RPS15 RPL5 RPL21 RPL14 RPLP0 RPS15A RPS13 RPL35A RPL9 RPS25 RPL6 HSPA1A RPS7 RPS16 JUN FOS RPS21 RPL24 MT-ND1 GAPDH MT-ND2 RACK1 FAU RPS5 MIF NACA TMSB4X ACTG1 RPL7 RPLP2 RPL35 UBC GSTP1 TMSB10 HSP90AB1 RPL27A H3-3B RPL36A RPL22\\nCell Type: secretory cell, Tissue: fimbria of uterine tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 RPL41 RPL13 RPL10 RPLP1 RPS12 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 RPS8 TPT1 RPS18 MT-ATP6 RPS4X RPS19 RPS14 RPL12 RPL7A MT-CO2 RPS24 RPL32 RPL26 RPL34 RPS27A RPL3 RPL11 RPS27 RPL28 MT-CYB RPS23 RPS6 RPS2 RPS3A RPS3 RPL29 RPL30 RPL19 RPL8 MT-ND3 RPL5 FTH1 MT-ND4 RPL18A RPS28 RPL10A RPL18 RPL39 RPL17 RPL37 CLU RPL21 RPL14 RPS15 RPS9 RPL36 RPL6 RPS15A RPS13 RPL35A RPL37A RPLP0 RPL13A RPL15 RPL9 RPS21 RPS25 RPS5 ACTG1 WFDC2 PTMA RPS7 RPL24 RPL23A RPS16 RACK1 RPS29 FAU NACA RPL35 KRT18 MT-ND1 RPL36A RPSA RPLP2 UBC H3-3B GSTP1 EIF1 RPL22 GAPDH ACTB SAT1 RPL27A IFITM3 NFKBIA RPL7 RPS26 TMSB4X RPS10 EEF1B2\\nCell Type: secretory cell, Tissue: isthmus of fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 RPL41 RPL10 RPS12 RPLP1 RPL13 RPS8 TPT1 RPS4X RPS18 RPS27A RPL12 MT-CO1 RPL34 RPS14 RPS19 RPL7A CLU RPS24 RPL32 MT-CO3 RPS23 RPL11 RPL26 RPL3 RPL30 RPS27 RPS3A RPS3 MT-ATP6 RPS6 RPL28 RPL5 RPL8 RPL19 RPL29 RPS2 MT-CO2 MT-CYB FTH1 RPL10A RPL14 RPS28 RPL18A RPL18 RPL39 MT-ND3 RPS15 RPL35A RPS9 RPL37 RPL36 RPS15A RPL21 RPS13 MT-ND4 RPL6 RPLP0 PTMA ACTG1 RPS25 WFDC2 RPS5 RPS21 RPL15 RPL9 RPL24 FAU RPS7 NACA RPL37A RACK1 RPL23A RPL17 RPS26 RPSA IFITM3 RPL13A RPL35 RPS29 KRT18 H3-3B RPS16 ACTB EIF1 GAPDH RPS10 RPL22 RPLP2 MT-ND1 JUND RPL36A UBC HSP90AB1 GSTP1 EEF1B2 CD74 NPM1 RPL7\\n\"}]}},\n",

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-β signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental.

CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium. Download figureOpen in new tab . Velocity analysis that uncovers two potential progenitor populations. A. B. C. In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005). Download figureOpen in new tab : Comparison of epithelial and stromal populations between healthy and disease status. A. B. C. D. E, F. Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease.

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-β signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental. Download figureOpen in new tab : Subtypes of ciliated cells. A. B-E. F. CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental. Download figureOpen in new tab : Stromal cell classification. A. B. C. D. Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium. Download figureOpen in new tab . Velocity analysis that uncovers two potential progenitor populations. A. B. C. In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005). Download figureOpen in new tab : Comparison of epithelial and stromal populations between healthy and disease status. A. B. C. D. E, F. Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types.

Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-β mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states–F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\\nDataset: Cell Type: smooth muscle cell, Tissue: fallopian tube, Disease: hydrosalpinx, Gene Expression: TAGLN TPM2 ACTA2 MGP MALAT1 MT-CO1 EEF1A1 ACTB FTH1 TMSB4X MYL6 SPARCL1 RPLP1 TPM1

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-β signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental.

CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental. Download figureOpen in new tab : Stromal cell classification. A. B. C. D. Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium. Download figureOpen in new tab . Velocity analysis that uncovers two potential progenitor populations. A. B. C. In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005). Download figureOpen in new tab : Comparison of epithelial and stromal populations between healthy and disease status. A. B. C. D. E, F. Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types. Download figureOpen in new tab : Model for epithelial differentiation trajectory A. B. C. A recent study by Dinh et. al. profiled human fallopian tube samples using 10X Chromium (Dinh et al. 2021). Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-β mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states–F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\\nDataset: Cell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: ampulla of uterine tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 RPL41 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-CYB MT-ATP6 FTH1 MT-CO2 MT-ND3 RPL13 RPL10 RPS8 TPT1 RPLP1 RPS4X MT-ND4 RPS27A RPL34 RPS14 HSP90AA1 RPL11 RPS12 H3-3B PTMA RPS27 RPL7A RPS24 RPL32 RPS3A RPS19 CAPS RPL26 RPL19 RPL30 RPL3 RPS6 RPL28 RPS23 RPL29 RPS18 RPL12 RPL8 RPL35A RPL21 RPL17 RPS2 RPL10A UBC RPS3 RPL5 RPS15 RPS28 S100A6 GSTP1 WFDC2 RPS25 MT-ND2 TUBB4B RPL6 RPL37 RPL14 RPL39 PRDX5 RPL18 RPL18A RPL36 RPL37A RPS15A FAU S100A11 SLPI RPL24 RPS13 RPL9 RPL13A RPS9 MT-ND1 ACTG1 RPL15 RPS7 TXN DYNLL1 CALM2 C20ORF85 H3-3A EIF1 CALM1 FOS RPLP0 NACA RPL23A RPS21 RPS5 RPS16 IGFBP7 ACTB RPL35 RACK1 TPPP3\\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ND3 MT-CYB MT-ATP6 MT-CO2 CAPS MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-ND4 FTH1 HSP90AA1 EEF1A1 MT-ND2 RPL41 IGFBP7 TXN TMEM190 DYNLL1 TMSB10 RPL13 MT-ND1 PTMA WFDC2 H3-3B B2M C20ORF85 RPS8 CALM1 TPT1 S100A11 TPPP3 RPS27A RPS27 C9ORF24 TFF3 PRDX5 RPL34 H3-3A RPL10 MT-ND5 RPLP1 RBP1 RPS4X RPS14 GSTP1 UBC RPS24 RPL11 RPL28 SCGB1D4 C1ORF194 RPL13A RPS3A RPL21 S100A6 AGR3 RPL19 TUBB4B RPL37A RPL30 MIF CALM2 RPL17 RPS18 RSPH1 ATP5IF1 HSP90AB1 RPL3 PIFO MYL6 RPL26 RPL7A RPS28 RPS19 RPL32 HOATZ RPL9 VIM RPL35A CKB RPS15 ATP5F1E EIF1 CETN2 RPS29 SNTN RPS6 HMGN3 RPL36 FAU RPS23 ITM2B AGR2 SAT1 RPL15 RPS12 RPL29 RPL23A HSPB1 RPL8\\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: fimbria of uterine tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ATP6 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-CYB FTH1 MT-CO2 RPL41 MT-ND3 EEF1A1 RPL13 TPT1 MT-ND4 RPLP1 RPL10 RPS8 RPS4X CAPS HSP90AA1 RPS14 RPS27A RPL34 RPL11 PTMA S100A11 H3-3B RPS24 RPS27 RPS6 RPS12 RPL32 RPS19 WFDC2 UBC RPL28 RPL7A RPS3A RPS18 RPL19 RPL3 RPL26 GSTP1 S100A6 RPL21 RPL30 RPL12 TUBB4B MT-ND2 SLPI RPL29 RPL17 MT-ND1 RPS23 RPL8 RPS2 JUNB DYNLL1 SAT1 EIF1 TXN RPL35A RPS15 IGFBP7 PRDX5 ACTG1 AGR2 RPS28 C20ORF85 RPL13A RPL10A RPL18A FOS RPL37A RPL6 RPS13 B2M RPS9 H3-3A RPL5 RPS25 RPL37 RPS3 RPL9 RPL18 CALM1 RPL36 RPL15 RPL39 CALM2 FAU RPS15A RPL14 RPS7 RPL24 C9ORF24 KRT18 RPS16 RPL23A MIF RPL35\\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: isthmus of fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 FTH1 RPL41 MT-ATP6 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-CYB MT-CO2 TPT1 MT-ND3 CAPS HSP90AA1 RPL13 RPLP1 RPS8 MT-ND4 RPL10 H3-3B PTMA RPS4X RPS27A RPL34 RPS24 GSTP1 TUBB4B RPL11 RPS14 S100A11 RPL19 RPS27 DYNLL1 RPS3A RPL32 TXN RPL3 RPL28 RPL7A CALM2 RPL26 RPS6 RPL30 RPL21 C20ORF85 PRDX5 RPS12 WFDC2 UBC RPS23 RPS19 S100A6 RPL6 CALM1 H3-3A RPL12 TMSB10 MT-ND2 RPL35A RPL8 RPS18 HSP90AB1 IGFBP7 RPL29 RPS15 RPS28 RPL39 RPL10A RPS25 C9ORF24 RPL5 RPL24 RPL37A RPL36 RPS7 RPL37 RPL18A RPL9 MT-ND1 FAU RPL15 RPL14 RPS13 RPS2 RPS3 EIF1 RPS15A MIF RPS9 RPL13A RPL17 C1ORF194 RPS16 CKB RPL18 RPL23A NACA HSPB1 SLPI B2M PIFO\\n\"}]}}]"
