Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6).

In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005).

Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease.

Potential role of TGF-\u03b2 mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states\u2013F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage.

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental.

CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium. Download figureOpen in new tab . Velocity analysis that uncovers two potential progenitor populations. A. B. C. In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005). Download figureOpen in new tab : Comparison of epithelial and stromal populations between healthy and disease status. A. B. C. D. E, F. Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types.

Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-\u03b2 mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states\u2013F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\nDataset: Cell Type: smooth muscle cell, Tissue: fallopian tube, Disease: hydrosalpinx, Gene Expression: TAGLN TPM2 ACTA2 MGP MALAT1 MT-CO1 EEF1A1 ACTB FTH1 TMSB4X MYL6 SPARCL1 RPLP1 TPM1

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental.

CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium. Download figureOpen in new tab . Velocity analysis that uncovers two potential progenitor populations. A. B. C. In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005). Download figureOpen in new tab : Comparison of epithelial and stromal populations between healthy and disease status. A. B. C. D. E, F. Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types. Download figureOpen in new tab : Model for epithelial differentiation trajectory A. B. C. A recent study by Dinh et. al. profiled human fallopian tube samples using 10X Chromium (Dinh et al. 2021). Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-\u03b2 mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states\u2013F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\nDataset: Cell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: ampulla of uterine tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 RPL41 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-CYB MT-ATP6 FTH1 MT-CO2 MT-ND3 RPL13 RPL10 RPS8 TPT1 RPLP1 RPS4X MT-ND4 RPS27A RPL34 RPS14 HSP90AA1 RPL11 RPS12 H3-3B PTMA RPS27 RPL7A RPS24 RPL32 RPS3A RPS19 CAPS RPL26 RPL19 RPL30 RPL3 RPS6 RPL28 RPS23 RPL29 RPS18 RPL12 RPL8 RPL35A RPL21 RPL17 RPS2 RPL10A UBC RPS3 RPL5 RPS15 RPS28 S100A6 GSTP1 WFDC2 RPS25 MT-ND2 TUBB4B RPL6 RPL37 RPL14 RPL39 PRDX5 RPL18 RPL18A RPL36 RPL37A RPS15A FAU S100A11 SLPI RPL24 RPS13 RPL9 RPL13A RPS9 MT-ND1 ACTG1 RPL15 RPS7 TXN DYNLL1 CALM2 C20ORF85 H3-3A EIF1 CALM1 FOS RPLP0 NACA RPL23A RPS21 RPS5 RPS16 IGFBP7 ACTB RPL35 RACK1 TPPP3\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ND3 MT-CYB MT-ATP6 MT-CO2 CAPS MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-ND4 FTH1 HSP90AA1 EEF1A1 MT-ND2 RPL41 IGFBP7 TXN TMEM190 DYNLL1 TMSB10 RPL13 MT-ND1 PTMA WFDC2 H3-3B B2M C20ORF85 RPS8 CALM1 TPT1 S100A11 TPPP3 RPS27A RPS27 C9ORF24 TFF3 PRDX5 RPL34 H3-3A RPL10 MT-ND5 RPLP1 RBP1 RPS4X RPS14 GSTP1 UBC RPS24 RPL11 RPL28 SCGB1D4 C1ORF194 RPL13A RPS3A RPL21 S100A6 AGR3 RPL19 TUBB4B RPL37A RPL30 MIF CALM2 RPL17 RPS18 RSPH1 ATP5IF1 HSP90AB1 RPL3 PIFO MYL6 RPL26 RPL7A RPS28 RPS19 RPL32 HOATZ RPL9 VIM RPL35A CKB RPS15 ATP5F1E EIF1 CETN2 RPS29 SNTN RPS6 HMGN3 RPL36 FAU RPS23 ITM2B AGR2 SAT1 RPL15 RPS12 RPL29 RPL23A HSPB1 RPL8\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: fimbria of uterine tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ATP6 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-CYB FTH1 MT-CO2 RPL41 MT-ND3 EEF1A1 RPL13 TPT1 MT-ND4 RPLP1 RPL10 RPS8 RPS4X CAPS HSP90AA1 RPS14 RPS27A RPL34 RPL11 PTMA S100A11 H3-3B RPS24 RPS27 RPS6 RPS12 RPL32 RPS19 WFDC2 UBC RPL28 RPL7A RPS3A RPS18 RPL19 RPL3 RPL26 GSTP1 S100A6 RPL21 RPL30 RPL12 TUBB4B MT-ND2 SLPI RPL29 RPL17 MT-ND1 RPS23 RPL8 RPS2 JUNB DYNLL1 SAT1 EIF1 TXN RPL35A RPS15 IGFBP7 PRDX5 ACTG1 AGR2 RPS28 C20ORF85 RPL13A RPL10A RPL18A FOS RPL37A RPL6 RPS13 B2M RPS9 H3-3A RPL5 RPS25 RPL37 RPS3 RPL9 RPL18 CALM1 RPL36 RPL15 RPL39 CALM2 FAU RPS15A RPL14 RPS7 RPL24 C9ORF24 KRT18 RPS16 RPL23A MIF RPL35\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: isthmus of fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 FTH1 RPL41 MT-ATP6 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-CYB MT-CO2 TPT1 MT-ND3 CAPS HSP90AA1 RPL13 RPLP1 RPS8 MT-ND4 RPL10 H3-3B PTMA RPS4X RPS27A RPL34 RPS24 GSTP1 TUBB4B RPL11 RPS14 S100A11 RPL19 RPS27 DYNLL1 RPS3A RPL32 TXN RPL3 RPL28 RPL7A CALM2 RPL26 RPS6 RPL30 RPL21 C20ORF85 PRDX5 RPS12 WFDC2 UBC RPS23 RPS19 S100A6 RPL6 CALM1 H3-3A RPL12 TMSB10 MT-ND2 RPL35A RPL8 RPS18 HSP90AB1 IGFBP7 RPL29 RPS15 RPS28 RPL39 RPL10A RPS25 C9ORF24 RPL5 RPL24 RPL37A RPL36 RPS7 RPL37 RPL18A RPL9 MT-ND1 FAU RPL15 RPL14 RPS13 RPS2 RPS3 EIF1 RPS15A MIF RPS9 RPL13A RPL17 C1ORF194 RPS16 CKB RPL18 RPL23A NACA HSPB1 SLPI B2M PIFO\n"}]}}

Here, we simultaneously assess microbiota and single immune cells across the healthy, adult human colon, with paired characterization of immune cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes, to delineate colonic immune niches at steady state. We describe distinct helper T cell activation and migration profiles along the colon and characterize the transcriptional adaptation trajectory of regulatory T cells between lymphoid tissue and colon. Finally, we show increasing B cell accumulation, clonal expansion and mutational frequency from the cecum to the sigmoid colon and link this to the increasing number of reactive bacterial species. Microbiome composition differs along distinct colon regions To create a map of bacterial composition at the mucosal surface of the colon, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA 16S rRNA sequencing of swabs from the mucosal surface of the cecum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon of 12 disease-free deceased transplant donors of European ancestry Methods, and Supplementary Table 1. In this study, we performed the first simultaneous assessment of the colonic mucosal microbiome and immune cells in human donors at steady state.\nDataset: Cell Type: plasmacytoid dendritic cell,

Enhanced understanding of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To provide insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host\u2013viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) cultures over a time course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target at the onset of infection, which we confirmed by electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Over the course of infection, the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and interleukin (IL)-6 but not IL-1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both infected and bystander cells. This provides a detailed characterization of genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human airway. Results Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human bronchial epithelial cells To characterize SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the human airway, we performed scRNA-seq of SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected airway epithelium.

(B) Volcano plots highlighting the most DEGs between infected and bystander populations in ciliated cells pooled from 1, 2, and 3 dpi samples, as ranked by the EMD. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001143.g006 Discussion To effectively treat COVID-19, we must first understand how SARS-CoV-2 causes disease and why the clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic infection to lethal disease. Our data reveal several novel viral transcripts, and our methodology differentiated infected from bystander cells. COVID-19 pathogenesis is characterized by a lag following viral transmission with symptom onset at day 7 and disease severity peaking 14 dpi [51,52]. By assessing the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected bronchial epithelial cells, we observed up-regulation of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and translation initiation and viral gene expression.\nDataset: Cell Type: lung neuroendocrine cell, Tissue: bronchial epithelial cell (cell culture), Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 S100A6 MT-CO1 MT-CO2 MT-ND3 TFF3 TMSB4X IGFBP5
