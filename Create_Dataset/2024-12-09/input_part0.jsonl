Diabetic kidney disease leads to proximal tubule injury and changes in chromatin accessibility that modify the activity of transcription factors involved in glucose metabolism and inflammation. Here we use single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that diabetic kidney disease leads to reduced accessibility of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites and an injury-associated expression signature in the proximal tubule. We hypothesize that chromatin accessibility is regulated by genetic background and closely-intertwined with metabolic memory, which pre-programs the proximal tubule to respond differently to external stimuli. Glucocorticoid excess has long been known to increase risk for type 2 diabetes, which raises the possibility that glucocorticoid receptor inhibition may mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of diabetic kidney disease. Patient demographics and clinical information For snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, a total of thirteen kidney cortex samples were obtained from control patients n  6, and patients with diabetic kidney disease DKD, n  7. DKD progression is multifactorial and contributing factors include hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypoxia, and inflammation64.\nDataset: Cell Type: kidney loop of Henle thick ascending limb epithelial

To systematically segregate the major populations, we initially characterized the cell identity at a low granularity level (level-2 and -3 annotation, and S1c). Next, we identified gene modules (programs) to define representative phenotypes for each category in greater detail (Table S3). Download figureOpen in new tab . Categorization of cell states in the GBmap. (a) UMAP and cell annotation of sub-clustered neoplastic, myeloid, lymphoid, and vascular territories (level-4 annotation, detailed cell states). (b) Expression of representative genes (left) of the different cell (sub)types part of the tumor vasculature. (c) Overview of the GBmap cell type/state composition from coarse (level 1) to fine (level 4). Within the TAMs, the BDM-enriched ontogeny displayed up-regulation of gene programs associated with classical monocytes (Pombo Antunes et al., 2021), interferon (INF)-induced genes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and tumor-supportive chemokines and S2c). On the vasculature, we defined cell (sub)types reported as being part of the brain blood vessels (Yang et al., 2022) as well as previously undescribed phenotypes,b and S2g). In summary, we created GBmap, a robust core reference atlas that delineates cell types and states. Reference mapping and large-scale integration by transfer learning One of the main goals of building a detailed GBmap is to provide a resource for the community to project unannotated \u2018query\u2019 datasets onto a harmonized reference.

(d) Diagram of comparison and machine-learning process applied to public and our own dataset. (e) Updated UMAP of the integrated GBmap and query datasets (extended GBmap). (f) Close-up of UMAP region identifying a neutrophil cluster not present in the core GBmap. (g) Projection of multi-sector biopsy datasets onto the extended GBmap, colored by region (core or periphery). (h) Expression of selected phenotypical microglia (CX3CR1, P2RY13) and tumor-induced genes (GPX1, CCL3L3) contrasting TAM-MG from the core GBmap and the predicted microglial cells on the Xie2021 dataset. The GBmap also transferred the information of fine cell subtypes to uncover phenotypes that otherwise would have remained hidden. It is anticipated that the GBmap will \u2018grow\u2019 over time as new studies will capture cell (sub)types that are not well or at all represented in the core GBmap reference. Comparing the TAM-MG cells in the core GBmap, we found a subset of MG cells in the extended GBmap that expressed higher levels of bona fide markers of a core transcriptional microglial signature (e.g., CX3CR1, P2RY13) and lower expression of catabolic (e.g., GPX1) or cell activation (e.g., CCL3L3) processes. These results show the utility of the GBmap in adding depth to hidden or overlooked findings of cell phenotypes. GB interactome uncovers signaling implicated in phenotypic turnover, immunomodulation, and angiogenesis The crosstalk between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells in the TME is thought to be pivotal in preserving cellular plasticity and impacting tumor growth and progression. Following L-R pairs inference in each condition, we analyzed them together via joint manifold learning and performed a classification of the detected networks based on their communication similarity.

(a) Shared two-dimensional manifold of jointly projected and clustered signaling pathways from healthy brain and GB according to their structural similarity. (b) Bar plot of the significant signaling pathways ranked based on their differences in overall information flow within the inferred networks between healthy brain (Song, et al., 2021) and GB. (c) Circos plots depict the inferred signaling network interaction among neoplastic, immune, and vascular cells. Our interactome robustly recovered well-established GB-specific signaling patterns, including signaling networks among cancer cells associated with tumor growth, adaptive mechanisms of resistance, and glioma stem cell maintenance (Han et al., 2019; L\u00f3pez-Valero et al., 2020; Osuka et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2017) (EGF, PTN, CDH, MK). The inferred interplay between MES-like neoplastic cells (and, to a lesser extent, vascular cells) with TAMs via PROS pathway (PROS1-AXL) suggests a potential mechanism by which tumor cells may inhibit pro-inflammatory TAMs polarization (Ubil et al., 2018). Our in silico communication modeling hints at additional pro-angiogenic signaling influx through non-conventional pathways. Overall, the GBmap provided the structural basis to create the signaling network within the TME. Regional organization of the GB TME Tissue organization and architecture influence cell behavior, and cell-cell interactions can impact tumor pathogenesis. Download figureOpen in new tab .

(f) Spatial maps of co-localized gene expression of key L-R pairs. The distribution of the cancer cell states revealed regionally conserved consistencies across multiple samples. Considering the estimated cell-type abundance in each spot, we randomly screened all different tumor samples and regions and applied a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to delve into the spatial co-occurrence of cells that determine \u2019compartments\u2019 within the TME. Investigating the spatial communication between neighborhoods, we found that several inferred L-R pairs were driven by MES-like dominated areas, in line with our in silico inference of the GB interactome (Fig. Collectively, our results provide insights into the architecture of GB and illustrate global spatiotemporal patterning, with co-localization of AC- and OPC-like and a predilected self- neighboring disposition of MES-like cancer cells. Tumor vasculature delineates territorial allocation of cancer states Our observations on the coarse ST data prompted us to resolve cell (co)localization at high resolution.

We provide the first single-cell resolution map of the spatial organization of GB and offer a detailed view of the TME architecture. DISCUSSION To tackle the challenge of confidently identifying and assigning cell identities, we gathered numerous published cohorts of patients and cells to capture the entire spectrum of cellular states in GB as much as possible. We showcase how the GBmap can accurately transfer the cell\u2019s identity to new GB datasets and uncover phenotypes that would have remained hidden without the atlas (e.g., Tregs). Additional extensions of the GBmap or data exploration from a different perspective will offer complementary information to improve our understanding of tumor pathobiology. On the analytical side, we exploited the GBmap to infer the cell-cell interaction panorama of GB. Integrating single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics (Visium), we uncovered an unprecedented territorial organization of the GB TME. In agreement with Gangoso and colleagues, who recently showed how epigenetic changes in MES-like cells favor the recruitment of circulating myeloid cells (Gangoso et al., 2021), we found that the MES-like compartment co-localizes with monocytes/TAM-BDM. The GBmap is a dynamic framework combining the single-cell transcriptomics of over 1 million cells that will benefit the scientific community by providing the opportunity to map new data, update the current model, scrutinize novel concepts, and generate hypotheses that can be explored experimentally.\nDataset: Cell Type: endothelial cell, Tissue: basal ganglion, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO3

To systematically segregate the major populations, we initially characterized the cell identity at a low granularity level (level-2 and -3 annotation, and S1c). Next, we identified gene modules (programs) to define representative phenotypes for each category in greater detail (Table S3). Download figureOpen in new tab . Categorization of cell states in the GBmap. (a) UMAP and cell annotation of sub-clustered neoplastic, myeloid, lymphoid, and vascular territories (level-4 annotation, detailed cell states). (b) Expression of representative genes (left) of the different cell (sub)types part of the tumor vasculature. (c) Overview of the GBmap cell type/state composition from coarse (level 1) to fine (level 4). Within the TAMs, the BDM-enriched ontogeny displayed up-regulation of gene programs associated with classical monocytes (Pombo Antunes et al., 2021), interferon (INF)-induced genes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and tumor-supportive chemokines and S2c). On the vasculature, we defined cell (sub)types reported as being part of the brain blood vessels (Yang et al., 2022) as well as previously undescribed phenotypes,b and S2g). In summary, we created GBmap, a robust core reference atlas that delineates cell types and states. Reference mapping and large-scale integration by transfer learning One of the main goals of building a detailed GBmap is to provide a resource for the community to project unannotated \u2018query\u2019 datasets onto a harmonized reference.

(f) Close-up of UMAP region identifying a neutrophil cluster not present in the core GBmap. (g) Projection of multi-sector biopsy datasets onto the extended GBmap, colored by region (core or periphery). (h) Expression of selected phenotypical microglia (CX3CR1, P2RY13) and tumor-induced genes (GPX1, CCL3L3) contrasting TAM-MG from the core GBmap and the predicted microglial cells on the Xie2021 dataset. The GBmap also transferred the information of fine cell subtypes to uncover phenotypes that otherwise would have remained hidden. It is anticipated that the GBmap will \u2018grow\u2019 over time as new studies will capture cell (sub)types that are not well or at all represented in the core GBmap reference. Comparing the TAM-MG cells in the core GBmap, we found a subset of MG cells in the extended GBmap that expressed higher levels of bona fide markers of a core transcriptional microglial signature (e.g., CX3CR1, P2RY13) and lower expression of catabolic (e.g., GPX1) or cell activation (e.g., CCL3L3) processes. These results show the utility of the GBmap in adding depth to hidden or overlooked findings of cell phenotypes. GB interactome uncovers signaling implicated in phenotypic turnover, immunomodulation, and angiogenesis The crosstalk between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells in the TME is thought to be pivotal in preserving cellular plasticity and impacting tumor growth and progression. Following L-R pairs inference in each condition, we analyzed them together via joint manifold learning and performed a classification of the detected networks based on their communication similarity. Download figureOpen in new tab . GB interactome. (a) Shared two-dimensional manifold of jointly projected and clustered signaling pathways from healthy brain and GB according to their structural similarity. (b) Bar plot of the significant signaling pathways ranked based on their differences in overall information flow within the inferred networks between healthy brain (Song, et al., 2021) and GB. (c) Circos plots depict the inferred signaling network interaction among neoplastic, immune, and vascular cells. Our interactome robustly recovered well-established GB-specific signaling patterns, including signaling networks among cancer cells associated with tumor growth, adaptive mechanisms of resistance, and glioma stem cell maintenance (Han et al., 2019; L\u00f3pez-Valero et al., 2020; Osuka et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2017) (EGF, PTN, CDH, MK). The inferred interplay between MES-like neoplastic cells (and, to a lesser extent, vascular cells) with TAMs via PROS pathway (PROS1-AXL) suggests a potential mechanism by which tumor cells may inhibit pro-inflammatory TAMs polarization (Ubil et al., 2018). Our in silico communication modeling hints at additional pro-angiogenic signaling influx through non-conventional pathways. Overall, the GBmap provided the structural basis to create the signaling network within the TME. Regional organization of the GB TME Tissue organization and architecture influence cell behavior, and cell-cell interactions can impact tumor pathogenesis. Download figureOpen in new tab .

Considering the estimated cell-type abundance in each spot, we randomly screened all different tumor samples and regions and applied a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to delve into the spatial co-occurrence of cells that determine \u2019compartments\u2019 within the TME. Investigating the spatial communication between neighborhoods, we found that several inferred L-R pairs were driven by MES-like dominated areas, in line with our in silico inference of the GB interactome (Fig. Collectively, our results provide insights into the architecture of GB and illustrate global spatiotemporal patterning, with co-localization of AC- and OPC-like and a predilected self- neighboring disposition of MES-like cancer cells. Tumor vasculature delineates territorial allocation of cancer states Our observations on the coarse ST data prompted us to resolve cell (co)localization at high resolution.

(b) Distribution of distances (x-axis) and neighborhood enrichment (y-axis) of malignant phenotypes to endothelial cells expressing VEGFA, and HILPDA. (c) Heatmap of clustering of neighborhood enrichment among cell types within a 50\u03bcm radius from each cell. (d) On the left-hand side, UMAP clustering of spatial analysis of the composition of the neighboring pattern identified within the range of 50 \u03bcm from each cell, colored by cell type. (e) Spatial map of preferential nearest neighbors of the neoplastic cells (see Methods), colored by sub-niches. To gain further insight into the cellular patches, we performed a neighborhood enrichment analysis and clustered the cells based on their nearest neighbors within a 50 \u00b5m radius. We provide the first single-cell resolution map of the spatial organization of GB and offer a detailed view of the TME architecture. DISCUSSION To tackle the challenge of confidently identifying and assigning cell identities, we gathered numerous published cohorts of patients and cells to capture the entire spectrum of cellular states in GB as much as possible. We showcase how the GBmap can accurately transfer the cell\u2019s identity to new GB datasets and uncover phenotypes that would have remained hidden without the atlas (e.g., Tregs). Additional extensions of the GBmap or data exploration from a different perspective will offer complementary information to improve our understanding of tumor pathobiology. On the analytical side, we exploited the GBmap to infer the cell-cell interaction panorama of GB. Integrating single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics (Visium), we uncovered an unprecedented territorial organization of the GB TME. In agreement with Gangoso and colleagues, who recently showed how epigenetic changes in MES-like cells favor the recruitment of circulating myeloid cells (Gangoso et al., 2021), we found that the MES-like compartment co-localizes with monocytes/TAM-BDM. The GBmap is a dynamic framework combining the single-cell transcriptomics of over 1 million cells that will benefit the scientific community by providing the opportunity to map new data, update the current model, scrutinize novel concepts, and generate hypotheses that can be explored experimentally.\nDataset: Cell Type: B cell, Tissue: left frontal lobe, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TMSB4X RPS27

However, the exact molecular differences between inactive adult and active fetal epicardium are not known. In this study, we combined fetal and adult human hearts using single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing and compared epicardial cells from both stages. We found that a migratory fibroblast-like epicardial population only in the fetal heart and fetal epicardium expressed angiogenic gene programs, whereas the adult epicardium was solely mesothelial and immune responsive. Furthermore, we predicted that adult hearts may still receive fetal epicardial paracrine communication, including WNT signaling with endocardium, reinforcing the validity of regenerative strategies that administer or reactivate epicardial cells in situ. Finally, we explained graft efficacy of our human embryonic stem-cell-derived epicardium model by noting its similarity to human fetal epicardium. Overall, our study defines epicardial programs of regenerative angiogenesis absent in adult hearts, contextualizes animal studies and defines epicardial states required for effective human heart regeneration. Two stages of the human heart are integrated Seven healthy fetal hearts between the gestational ages of week 8 and 12 were dissected, taking the base and apex from six donors and the apex attached to peeled epicardium from one. Epicardial activity appears to be an important element of heart regeneration.\nDataset: Cell Type: fat cell, Tissue: right cardiac atrium, Gene Expression: MALAT1 NEAT1 GPAM DLC1 MGST1 SOX5 LINGO1

Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies. Profiling AD progression across pathological stages To construct an integrated multimodal cellular atlas of AD and comorbid related disorders ADAD and related dementias we generated 1 quantitative neuropathological measurements, 2 single-nucleus RNA sequencing snRNA-seq, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing snATACseq and single-nucleus multiome snMultiome, and 3 cellularly resolved spatial transcriptomics multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization MERFISH in the MTG from a cohort of 84 aged donors spanning the spectrum of AD pathology and Extended Data. We describe an integrated atlas of AD in the MTG, selected both as a transition area in AD pathology4 and the region with the greatest aggregated knowledge about cell type phenotypes20,21,22.\nDataset: Cell Type: oligodendrocyte precursor cell, Tissue: middle temporal gyrus, Disease: dementia, Gene Expression: MALAT1 PCDH9 DSCAM CSMD1 LRRC4C LRP1B OPCML NRXN1 NLGN1 LSAMP KCNIP4 LHFPL3 TNR CADM2 LRRTM4 PTPRZ1 FGF14 PCDH15 ADGRL3 DPP6 NPAS3 ADGRB3 ERBB4 GRID2 NTM IL1RAPL1 NCAM2 DLG2 MDGA2 KCND2 RORA PDZD2 NRCAM SNTG1 KCNMB2 FAM155A PDE4B AGAP1 CSMD3 VCAN QKI SLC35F1 CTNND2 SOX5 KAZN NOVA1 ATRNL1 ZBTB20 SOX6 MMP16 GRM7 XYLT1 LRRC7 CHST11 ANKS1B LUZP2 ZFPM2 CTNNA2 NRG3 FGF12 DLGAP1 DCC EPN2 GPM6A DMD DGKG PRKCA GRIK2 CNTN1 NXPH1 ADARB2 ZSWIM6 DAB1 RP11-384F7 GALNT13 CA10 WWOX SCD5 NCAM1 MAGI2 MEGF11 BRINP3 SMOC1 NAV2 DNM3 PTPRG MARCHF1 GRIA2 SEMA5A CHL1 NAV3 PTPRD OPHN1 FTX KCNMA1 MAML2 FHIT MIR99AHG KAT2B TCF4\nCell Type: oligodendrocyte precursor cell, Tissue: middle temporal gyrus, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 PCDH9 DSCAM CSMD1 LRRC4C LRP1B OPCML NRXN1 LSAMP LHFPL3 NLGN1 KCNIP4 TNR CADM2 LRRTM4 PCDH15 PTPRZ1 ADGRL3 DPP6 FGF14 NPAS3 ADGRB3 GRID2 NTM ERBB4 DLG2 IL1RAPL1 MDGA2 NCAM2 SNTG1 RORA AGAP1 FAM155A KCND2 NRCAM CSMD3 KCNMB2 PDE4B PDZD2 QKI NOVA1 KAZN SLC35F1 CTNND2 VCAN SOX5 XYLT1 ZBTB20 SOX6 ATRNL1 ANKS1B MMP16 LUZP2 GRM7 CHST11 LRRC7 FGF12 EPN2 DLGAP1 CTNNA2 GPM6A DCC NRG3 GRIK2 PRKCA ADARB2 NXPH1 DMD ZSWIM6 RP11-384F7 CNTN1 DAB1 SCD5 NCAM1 CA10 ZFPM2 MAGI2 GALNT13 WWOX DGKG DNM3 BRINP3 MARCHF1 PTPRG NAV2 GRIA2 SGCZ SEMA5A MEGF11 OPHN1 FTX PTPRD CHL1 NAV3 SMOC1 MAML2 KCNMA1 MIR99AHG PDE4D FHIT\n"}]}}

Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies.

Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies. Profiling AD progression across pathological stages To construct an integrated multimodal cellular atlas of AD and comorbid related disorders ADAD and related dementias we generated 1 quantitative neuropathological measurements, 2 single-nucleus RNA sequencing snRNA-seq, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing snATACseq and single-nucleus multiome snMultiome, and 3 cellularly resolved spatial transcriptomics multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization MERFISH in the MTG from a cohort of 84 aged donors spanning the spectrum of AD pathology and Extended Data.

Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies.
