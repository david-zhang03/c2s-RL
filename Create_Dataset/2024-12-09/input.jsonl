Diabetic kidney disease leads to proximal tubule injury and changes in chromatin accessibility that modify the activity of transcription factors involved in glucose metabolism and inflammation. Here we use single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that diabetic kidney disease leads to reduced accessibility of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites and an injury-associated expression signature in the proximal tubule. We hypothesize that chromatin accessibility is regulated by genetic background and closely-intertwined with metabolic memory, which pre-programs the proximal tubule to respond differently to external stimuli. Glucocorticoid excess has long been known to increase risk for type 2 diabetes, which raises the possibility that glucocorticoid receptor inhibition may mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of diabetic kidney disease. Patient demographics and clinical information For snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, a total of thirteen kidney cortex samples were obtained from control patients n  6, and patients with diabetic kidney disease DKD, n  7. DKD progression is multifactorial and contributing factors include hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypoxia, and inflammation64.\nDataset: Cell Type: kidney loop of Henle thick ascending limb epithelial

To systematically segregate the major populations, we initially characterized the cell identity at a low granularity level (level-2 and -3 annotation, and S1c). Next, we identified gene modules (programs) to define representative phenotypes for each category in greater detail (Table S3). Download figureOpen in new tab . Categorization of cell states in the GBmap. (a) UMAP and cell annotation of sub-clustered neoplastic, myeloid, lymphoid, and vascular territories (level-4 annotation, detailed cell states). (b) Expression of representative genes (left) of the different cell (sub)types part of the tumor vasculature. (c) Overview of the GBmap cell type/state composition from coarse (level 1) to fine (level 4). Within the TAMs, the BDM-enriched ontogeny displayed up-regulation of gene programs associated with classical monocytes (Pombo Antunes et al., 2021), interferon (INF)-induced genes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and tumor-supportive chemokines and S2c). On the vasculature, we defined cell (sub)types reported as being part of the brain blood vessels (Yang et al., 2022) as well as previously undescribed phenotypes,b and S2g). In summary, we created GBmap, a robust core reference atlas that delineates cell types and states. Reference mapping and large-scale integration by transfer learning One of the main goals of building a detailed GBmap is to provide a resource for the community to project unannotated \u2018query\u2019 datasets onto a harmonized reference.

(d) Diagram of comparison and machine-learning process applied to public and our own dataset. (e) Updated UMAP of the integrated GBmap and query datasets (extended GBmap). (f) Close-up of UMAP region identifying a neutrophil cluster not present in the core GBmap. (g) Projection of multi-sector biopsy datasets onto the extended GBmap, colored by region (core or periphery). (h) Expression of selected phenotypical microglia (CX3CR1, P2RY13) and tumor-induced genes (GPX1, CCL3L3) contrasting TAM-MG from the core GBmap and the predicted microglial cells on the Xie2021 dataset. The GBmap also transferred the information of fine cell subtypes to uncover phenotypes that otherwise would have remained hidden. It is anticipated that the GBmap will \u2018grow\u2019 over time as new studies will capture cell (sub)types that are not well or at all represented in the core GBmap reference. Comparing the TAM-MG cells in the core GBmap, we found a subset of MG cells in the extended GBmap that expressed higher levels of bona fide markers of a core transcriptional microglial signature (e.g., CX3CR1, P2RY13) and lower expression of catabolic (e.g., GPX1) or cell activation (e.g., CCL3L3) processes. These results show the utility of the GBmap in adding depth to hidden or overlooked findings of cell phenotypes. GB interactome uncovers signaling implicated in phenotypic turnover, immunomodulation, and angiogenesis The crosstalk between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells in the TME is thought to be pivotal in preserving cellular plasticity and impacting tumor growth and progression. Following L-R pairs inference in each condition, we analyzed them together via joint manifold learning and performed a classification of the detected networks based on their communication similarity.

(a) Shared two-dimensional manifold of jointly projected and clustered signaling pathways from healthy brain and GB according to their structural similarity. (b) Bar plot of the significant signaling pathways ranked based on their differences in overall information flow within the inferred networks between healthy brain (Song, et al., 2021) and GB. (c) Circos plots depict the inferred signaling network interaction among neoplastic, immune, and vascular cells. Our interactome robustly recovered well-established GB-specific signaling patterns, including signaling networks among cancer cells associated with tumor growth, adaptive mechanisms of resistance, and glioma stem cell maintenance (Han et al., 2019; L\u00f3pez-Valero et al., 2020; Osuka et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2017) (EGF, PTN, CDH, MK). The inferred interplay between MES-like neoplastic cells (and, to a lesser extent, vascular cells) with TAMs via PROS pathway (PROS1-AXL) suggests a potential mechanism by which tumor cells may inhibit pro-inflammatory TAMs polarization (Ubil et al., 2018). Our in silico communication modeling hints at additional pro-angiogenic signaling influx through non-conventional pathways. Overall, the GBmap provided the structural basis to create the signaling network within the TME. Regional organization of the GB TME Tissue organization and architecture influence cell behavior, and cell-cell interactions can impact tumor pathogenesis. Download figureOpen in new tab .

(f) Spatial maps of co-localized gene expression of key L-R pairs. The distribution of the cancer cell states revealed regionally conserved consistencies across multiple samples. Considering the estimated cell-type abundance in each spot, we randomly screened all different tumor samples and regions and applied a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to delve into the spatial co-occurrence of cells that determine \u2019compartments\u2019 within the TME. Investigating the spatial communication between neighborhoods, we found that several inferred L-R pairs were driven by MES-like dominated areas, in line with our in silico inference of the GB interactome (Fig. Collectively, our results provide insights into the architecture of GB and illustrate global spatiotemporal patterning, with co-localization of AC- and OPC-like and a predilected self- neighboring disposition of MES-like cancer cells. Tumor vasculature delineates territorial allocation of cancer states Our observations on the coarse ST data prompted us to resolve cell (co)localization at high resolution.

We provide the first single-cell resolution map of the spatial organization of GB and offer a detailed view of the TME architecture. DISCUSSION To tackle the challenge of confidently identifying and assigning cell identities, we gathered numerous published cohorts of patients and cells to capture the entire spectrum of cellular states in GB as much as possible. We showcase how the GBmap can accurately transfer the cell\u2019s identity to new GB datasets and uncover phenotypes that would have remained hidden without the atlas (e.g., Tregs). Additional extensions of the GBmap or data exploration from a different perspective will offer complementary information to improve our understanding of tumor pathobiology. On the analytical side, we exploited the GBmap to infer the cell-cell interaction panorama of GB. Integrating single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics (Visium), we uncovered an unprecedented territorial organization of the GB TME. In agreement with Gangoso and colleagues, who recently showed how epigenetic changes in MES-like cells favor the recruitment of circulating myeloid cells (Gangoso et al., 2021), we found that the MES-like compartment co-localizes with monocytes/TAM-BDM. The GBmap is a dynamic framework combining the single-cell transcriptomics of over 1 million cells that will benefit the scientific community by providing the opportunity to map new data, update the current model, scrutinize novel concepts, and generate hypotheses that can be explored experimentally.\nDataset: Cell Type: endothelial cell, Tissue: basal ganglion, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO3

To systematically segregate the major populations, we initially characterized the cell identity at a low granularity level (level-2 and -3 annotation, and S1c). Next, we identified gene modules (programs) to define representative phenotypes for each category in greater detail (Table S3). Download figureOpen in new tab . Categorization of cell states in the GBmap. (a) UMAP and cell annotation of sub-clustered neoplastic, myeloid, lymphoid, and vascular territories (level-4 annotation, detailed cell states). (b) Expression of representative genes (left) of the different cell (sub)types part of the tumor vasculature. (c) Overview of the GBmap cell type/state composition from coarse (level 1) to fine (level 4). Within the TAMs, the BDM-enriched ontogeny displayed up-regulation of gene programs associated with classical monocytes (Pombo Antunes et al., 2021), interferon (INF)-induced genes, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and tumor-supportive chemokines and S2c). On the vasculature, we defined cell (sub)types reported as being part of the brain blood vessels (Yang et al., 2022) as well as previously undescribed phenotypes,b and S2g). In summary, we created GBmap, a robust core reference atlas that delineates cell types and states. Reference mapping and large-scale integration by transfer learning One of the main goals of building a detailed GBmap is to provide a resource for the community to project unannotated \u2018query\u2019 datasets onto a harmonized reference.

(f) Close-up of UMAP region identifying a neutrophil cluster not present in the core GBmap. (g) Projection of multi-sector biopsy datasets onto the extended GBmap, colored by region (core or periphery). (h) Expression of selected phenotypical microglia (CX3CR1, P2RY13) and tumor-induced genes (GPX1, CCL3L3) contrasting TAM-MG from the core GBmap and the predicted microglial cells on the Xie2021 dataset. The GBmap also transferred the information of fine cell subtypes to uncover phenotypes that otherwise would have remained hidden. It is anticipated that the GBmap will \u2018grow\u2019 over time as new studies will capture cell (sub)types that are not well or at all represented in the core GBmap reference. Comparing the TAM-MG cells in the core GBmap, we found a subset of MG cells in the extended GBmap that expressed higher levels of bona fide markers of a core transcriptional microglial signature (e.g., CX3CR1, P2RY13) and lower expression of catabolic (e.g., GPX1) or cell activation (e.g., CCL3L3) processes. These results show the utility of the GBmap in adding depth to hidden or overlooked findings of cell phenotypes. GB interactome uncovers signaling implicated in phenotypic turnover, immunomodulation, and angiogenesis The crosstalk between neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells in the TME is thought to be pivotal in preserving cellular plasticity and impacting tumor growth and progression. Following L-R pairs inference in each condition, we analyzed them together via joint manifold learning and performed a classification of the detected networks based on their communication similarity. Download figureOpen in new tab . GB interactome. (a) Shared two-dimensional manifold of jointly projected and clustered signaling pathways from healthy brain and GB according to their structural similarity. (b) Bar plot of the significant signaling pathways ranked based on their differences in overall information flow within the inferred networks between healthy brain (Song, et al., 2021) and GB. (c) Circos plots depict the inferred signaling network interaction among neoplastic, immune, and vascular cells. Our interactome robustly recovered well-established GB-specific signaling patterns, including signaling networks among cancer cells associated with tumor growth, adaptive mechanisms of resistance, and glioma stem cell maintenance (Han et al., 2019; L\u00f3pez-Valero et al., 2020; Osuka et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2017) (EGF, PTN, CDH, MK). The inferred interplay between MES-like neoplastic cells (and, to a lesser extent, vascular cells) with TAMs via PROS pathway (PROS1-AXL) suggests a potential mechanism by which tumor cells may inhibit pro-inflammatory TAMs polarization (Ubil et al., 2018). Our in silico communication modeling hints at additional pro-angiogenic signaling influx through non-conventional pathways. Overall, the GBmap provided the structural basis to create the signaling network within the TME. Regional organization of the GB TME Tissue organization and architecture influence cell behavior, and cell-cell interactions can impact tumor pathogenesis. Download figureOpen in new tab .

Considering the estimated cell-type abundance in each spot, we randomly screened all different tumor samples and regions and applied a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to delve into the spatial co-occurrence of cells that determine \u2019compartments\u2019 within the TME. Investigating the spatial communication between neighborhoods, we found that several inferred L-R pairs were driven by MES-like dominated areas, in line with our in silico inference of the GB interactome (Fig. Collectively, our results provide insights into the architecture of GB and illustrate global spatiotemporal patterning, with co-localization of AC- and OPC-like and a predilected self- neighboring disposition of MES-like cancer cells. Tumor vasculature delineates territorial allocation of cancer states Our observations on the coarse ST data prompted us to resolve cell (co)localization at high resolution.

(b) Distribution of distances (x-axis) and neighborhood enrichment (y-axis) of malignant phenotypes to endothelial cells expressing VEGFA, and HILPDA. (c) Heatmap of clustering of neighborhood enrichment among cell types within a 50\u03bcm radius from each cell. (d) On the left-hand side, UMAP clustering of spatial analysis of the composition of the neighboring pattern identified within the range of 50 \u03bcm from each cell, colored by cell type. (e) Spatial map of preferential nearest neighbors of the neoplastic cells (see Methods), colored by sub-niches. To gain further insight into the cellular patches, we performed a neighborhood enrichment analysis and clustered the cells based on their nearest neighbors within a 50 \u00b5m radius. We provide the first single-cell resolution map of the spatial organization of GB and offer a detailed view of the TME architecture. DISCUSSION To tackle the challenge of confidently identifying and assigning cell identities, we gathered numerous published cohorts of patients and cells to capture the entire spectrum of cellular states in GB as much as possible. We showcase how the GBmap can accurately transfer the cell\u2019s identity to new GB datasets and uncover phenotypes that would have remained hidden without the atlas (e.g., Tregs). Additional extensions of the GBmap or data exploration from a different perspective will offer complementary information to improve our understanding of tumor pathobiology. On the analytical side, we exploited the GBmap to infer the cell-cell interaction panorama of GB. Integrating single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics (Visium), we uncovered an unprecedented territorial organization of the GB TME. In agreement with Gangoso and colleagues, who recently showed how epigenetic changes in MES-like cells favor the recruitment of circulating myeloid cells (Gangoso et al., 2021), we found that the MES-like compartment co-localizes with monocytes/TAM-BDM. The GBmap is a dynamic framework combining the single-cell transcriptomics of over 1 million cells that will benefit the scientific community by providing the opportunity to map new data, update the current model, scrutinize novel concepts, and generate hypotheses that can be explored experimentally.\nDataset: Cell Type: B cell, Tissue: left frontal lobe, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TMSB4X RPS27

However, the exact molecular differences between inactive adult and active fetal epicardium are not known. In this study, we combined fetal and adult human hearts using single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing and compared epicardial cells from both stages. We found that a migratory fibroblast-like epicardial population only in the fetal heart and fetal epicardium expressed angiogenic gene programs, whereas the adult epicardium was solely mesothelial and immune responsive. Furthermore, we predicted that adult hearts may still receive fetal epicardial paracrine communication, including WNT signaling with endocardium, reinforcing the validity of regenerative strategies that administer or reactivate epicardial cells in situ. Finally, we explained graft efficacy of our human embryonic stem-cell-derived epicardium model by noting its similarity to human fetal epicardium. Overall, our study defines epicardial programs of regenerative angiogenesis absent in adult hearts, contextualizes animal studies and defines epicardial states required for effective human heart regeneration. Two stages of the human heart are integrated Seven healthy fetal hearts between the gestational ages of week 8 and 12 were dissected, taking the base and apex from six donors and the apex attached to peeled epicardium from one. Epicardial activity appears to be an important element of heart regeneration.\nDataset: Cell Type: fat cell, Tissue: right cardiac atrium, Gene Expression: MALAT1 NEAT1 GPAM DLC1 MGST1 SOX5 LINGO1

Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies. Profiling AD progression across pathological stages To construct an integrated multimodal cellular atlas of AD and comorbid related disorders ADAD and related dementias we generated 1 quantitative neuropathological measurements, 2 single-nucleus RNA sequencing snRNA-seq, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing snATACseq and single-nucleus multiome snMultiome, and 3 cellularly resolved spatial transcriptomics multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization MERFISH in the MTG from a cohort of 84 aged donors spanning the spectrum of AD pathology and Extended Data. We describe an integrated atlas of AD in the MTG, selected both as a transition area in AD pathology4 and the region with the greatest aggregated knowledge about cell type phenotypes20,21,22.\nDataset: Cell Type: oligodendrocyte precursor cell, Tissue: middle temporal gyrus, Disease: dementia, Gene Expression: MALAT1 PCDH9 DSCAM CSMD1 LRRC4C LRP1B OPCML NRXN1 NLGN1 LSAMP KCNIP4 LHFPL3 TNR CADM2 LRRTM4 PTPRZ1 FGF14 PCDH15 ADGRL3 DPP6 NPAS3 ADGRB3 ERBB4 GRID2 NTM IL1RAPL1 NCAM2 DLG2 MDGA2 KCND2 RORA PDZD2 NRCAM SNTG1 KCNMB2 FAM155A PDE4B AGAP1 CSMD3 VCAN QKI SLC35F1 CTNND2 SOX5 KAZN NOVA1 ATRNL1 ZBTB20 SOX6 MMP16 GRM7 XYLT1 LRRC7 CHST11 ANKS1B LUZP2 ZFPM2 CTNNA2 NRG3 FGF12 DLGAP1 DCC EPN2 GPM6A DMD DGKG PRKCA GRIK2 CNTN1 NXPH1 ADARB2 ZSWIM6 DAB1 RP11-384F7 GALNT13 CA10 WWOX SCD5 NCAM1 MAGI2 MEGF11 BRINP3 SMOC1 NAV2 DNM3 PTPRG MARCHF1 GRIA2 SEMA5A CHL1 NAV3 PTPRD OPHN1 FTX KCNMA1 MAML2 FHIT MIR99AHG KAT2B TCF4\nCell Type: oligodendrocyte precursor cell, Tissue: middle temporal gyrus, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 PCDH9 DSCAM CSMD1 LRRC4C LRP1B OPCML NRXN1 LSAMP LHFPL3 NLGN1 KCNIP4 TNR CADM2 LRRTM4 PCDH15 PTPRZ1 ADGRL3 DPP6 FGF14 NPAS3 ADGRB3 GRID2 NTM ERBB4 DLG2 IL1RAPL1 MDGA2 NCAM2 SNTG1 RORA AGAP1 FAM155A KCND2 NRCAM CSMD3 KCNMB2 PDE4B PDZD2 QKI NOVA1 KAZN SLC35F1 CTNND2 VCAN SOX5 XYLT1 ZBTB20 SOX6 ATRNL1 ANKS1B MMP16 LUZP2 GRM7 CHST11 LRRC7 FGF12 EPN2 DLGAP1 CTNNA2 GPM6A DCC NRG3 GRIK2 PRKCA ADARB2 NXPH1 DMD ZSWIM6 RP11-384F7 CNTN1 DAB1 SCD5 NCAM1 CA10 ZFPM2 MAGI2 GALNT13 WWOX DGKG DNM3 BRINP3 MARCHF1 PTPRG NAV2 GRIA2 SGCZ SEMA5A MEGF11 OPHN1 FTX PTPRD CHL1 NAV3 SMOC1 MAML2 KCNMA1 MIR99AHG PDE4D FHIT\n"}]}}

Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies.

Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies. Profiling AD progression across pathological stages To construct an integrated multimodal cellular atlas of AD and comorbid related disorders ADAD and related dementias we generated 1 quantitative neuropathological measurements, 2 single-nucleus RNA sequencing snRNA-seq, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing snATACseq and single-nucleus multiome snMultiome, and 3 cellularly resolved spatial transcriptomics multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization MERFISH in the MTG from a cohort of 84 aged donors spanning the spectrum of AD pathology and Extended Data.

Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies. Profiling AD progression across pathological stages To construct an integrated multimodal cellular atlas of AD and comorbid related disorders ADAD and related dementias we generated 1 quantitative neuropathological measurements, 2 single-nucleus RNA sequencing snRNA-seq, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing snATACseq and single-nucleus multiome snMultiome, and 3 cellularly resolved spatial transcriptomics multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization MERFISH in the MTG from a cohort of 84 aged donors spanning the spectrum of AD pathology and Extended Data.

Incomplete genetic penetrance and ample phenotypic expressivity in CVID suggest the participation of additional pathogenic mechanisms. Monozygotic MZ twins discordant for CVID are uniquely valuable for studying the contribution of epigenetics to the disease. Here, we generate a single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics census of na\u00efve-to-memory B cell differentiation in a CVID-discordant MZ twin pair. Our analysis identifies DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and transcriptional defects in memory B-cells mirroring defective cell-cell communication upon activation. These findings are validated in a cohort of CVID patients and healthy donors. Our findings provide a comprehensive multi-omics map of alterations in na\u00efve-to-memory B-cell transition in CVID and indicate links between the epigenome and immune cell cross-talk. Our resource, publicly available at the Human Cell Atlas, gives insight into future diagnosis and treatments of CVID patients. DNA methylation alterations in CVID in memory B-cell differentiation To define the DNA methylation profiles in CVID, we performed single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of B cells isolated from a pair of CVID-discordant MZ twins without identified pathogenic mutations. In this study, the use of multi-omics single-cell atlas technologies allowed us to identify functional alterations occurring in specific scarce immune cell populations that would have gone undetected if conventional bulk-based approaches had been used.\nDataset: Cell Type: class switched memory B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: common variable immunodeficiency, Gene Expression: MALAT1 CD74 MT-CO1 B2M MT-CO3 EEF1A1 MT-CYB HLA-B MT-ND4 RPS27 ACTB RPL3 MT-CO2 MT-ND1 HLA-DRA RPL13A MT-ND5 TMSB4X RPLP1 RPS18 MT-ND2 HLA-C RPS3 RPS14 MT-ATP6 PTMA LAPTM5 RPL13 RPS6 HLA-A RPL11 RPS27A RPL21 RPS19 RPL19 RPL8 RPL7 RPL5 RPS2 RPLP2 RPL27A RPL31 CD79A RPL10 RPL34 RPLP0 RPL32 RPL4 RPS4X RPS13 FTL RPS12 RPL9 RPL15 RPS11 RPL18 CXCR4 MT-ND4L RPL18A EZR HLA-E EIF1 TXNIP RPS5 COX4I1 RPS15 HLA-DRB1 RPL37 RPL37A RPS20 HLA-DPB1 RPS16 RPS29 RPL6 RPL36 SYNGR2 RPL7A NFKBIA PABPC1 RPSA RPS7 RPL41 RPS25 RPL10A BTG1 HNRNPA1 RPS3A RPS8 RPS9 RPL29 RPS24 DDX5 IGHA1 RPL27 HLA-DQB1 RPL35A EEF1B2 HLA-DPA1 RPL14 UBA52\nCell Type: class switched memory B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 CD74 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 B2M EEF1A1 MT-CYB HLA-B RPS27 RPL3 MT-ND4 ACTB MT-CO2 MT-ND1 RPL13A RPS14 RPLP1 HLA-DRA RPS18 MT-ND5 RPS3 RPL13 HLA-C PTMA MT-ATP6 MT-ND2 RPS6 TMSB4X HLA-A LAPTM5 RPL21 RPS27A RPS19 RPL8 RPL11 RPLP2 RPL10 RPL5 RPL31 RPL27A RPL19 RPL34 RPL7 TXNIP RPL32 RPLP0 RPL4 RPL15 RPS12 CXCR4 FTL RPS2 RPL9 NFKBIA RPS13 EZR RPL18 CD79A RPS4X MT-ND4L EIF1 RPL18A RPS11 RPS15 HLA-E RPS29 RPL6 RPS5 RPL37A RPS16 RPL37 RPS20 RPL36 SYNGR2 COX4I1 RPL10A RPS25 PABPC1 RPSA RPS7 RPS9 RPS8 HLA-DRB1 EEF1B2 RPL7A RPL41 RPL27 HLA-DPB1 RPS3A RPL14 RPL29 RPS26 TAGLN2 HNRNPA1 RPS24 RPL35A RPL12 UBC DDX5 PPIA\nCell Type: naive B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: common variable immunodeficiency, Gene Expression: CD74 MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 B2M RPS27 MT-CYB EEF1A1 MT-CO2 MT-ND4 HLA-B LAPTM5 MT-ND1 RPL13A MT-ATP6 MT-ND2 RPLP1 RPL3 MT-ND5 RPS27A RPS18 RPL13 RPL21 RPS14 RPS19 RPL34 RPL11 RPS3 PTMA RPLP2 HLA-DRA RPL32 RPL7 RPL31 RPL27A RPS6 RPL19 CD79A CXCR4 RPL8 RPS2 RPS13 RPL10 HLA-C RPL18A RPS11 RPL9 TMSB4X RPS12 RPL37 RPS29 EZR BTG1 RPL5 IGHM RPLP0 RPL37A RPL18 HLA-A RPL15 MT-ND4L ACTB RPS4X RPS15 EIF1 COX4I1 TXNIP RPL36 FTL RPL12 RPL4 RPS20 MT-ND3 RPL27 RPS26 RPS3A RPL41 IGHD FAU RPS16 ADAM28 RPS9 RPL35A UBA52 RPS25 RPL6 RPL35 HLA-DPB1 RPS5 RPS28 NFKBIA RPS8 RPL29 RPL23 RPL7A RPS7 RPS24 RPSA PABPC1 RPL14\nCell Type: naive B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: CD74 MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 RPS27 B2M EEF1A1 MT-CYB LAPTM5 MT-ND4 RPL13A MT-CO2 HLA-B RPS27A RPS19 RPL13 MT-ATP6 MT-ND1 RPS18 RPL21 RPLP1 RPL3 RPS14 MT-ND2 CD79A MT-ND5 RPS3 RPL34 RPS6 CXCR4 RPLP2 RPL32 RPL11 RPL19 RPL7 PTMA RPL10 RPL8 RPL31 HLA-DRA RPL9 RPS29 BTG1 RPS12 RPL18A RPS13 RPL27A TXNIP RPL37 HLA-C RPS11 EZR RPL15 RPL37A IGHM ACTB TMSB4X RPS4X RPLP0 RPL18 RPS15 RPL5 COX4I1 MT-ND4L RPL36 RPS3A RPS20 RPL41 RPS2 RPL4 RPL35A HLA-A RPS26 RPL12 MT-ND3 RPS16 FAU RPL27 EIF1 IGHD RPS5 RPS25 RPS24 FTL UBA52 CD83 RPL10A RPS9 ADAM28 RPS8 RPS7 RPL35 RPL7A RPL39 RPS28 RPL6 RPL23 RPS21 PABPC1 TSC22D3\nCell Type: unswitched memory B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: common variable immunodeficiency, Gene Expression: MALAT1 CD74 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 B2M EEF1A1 MT-CYB HLA-B RPS27 LAPTM5 MT-ND4 ACTB RPL3 RPL13A MT-ND1 MT-CO2 HLA-DRA MT-ND5 PTMA RPS18 MT-ND2 MT-ATP6 RPL13 RPS3 RPS14 RPLP1 HLA-C RPS6 CD79A IGHM RPS27A HLA-A RPL8 RPL21 RPS19 TMSB4X RPL11 RPL34 RPL19 RPS2 RPL10 RPLP2 RPL31 RPL27A RPL32 RPL5 RPL7 RPS4X CXCR4 RPS13 EZR RPL4 RPL9 RPS12 BTG1 RPL18 RPLP0 RPS11 FTL RPL15 RPL18A MT-ND4L RPS15 HLA-DPB1 EIF1 HLA-E HLA-DRB1 RPL37 RPS16 COX4I1 RPL37A RPL6 RPS29 RPL7A RPS5 SYNGR2 RPS20 RPL36 PABPC1 RPS9 TNFRSF13C RGS2 TXNIP RPSA RPL10A RPL41 RPS8 RPS7 RPL29 HLA-DQB1 RPL12 RPS24 EEF1B2 RPL14 RPS25 RPS3A DDX5 ARPC2 CFL1 RPL35A\nCell Type: unswitched memory B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 CD74 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 B2M EEF1A1 MT-CYB HLA-B LAPTM5 RPS27 MT-ND4 RPL3 HLA-DRA RPL13A ACTB MT-ND1 MT-CO2 PTMA RPS14 CD79A MT-ND5 MT-ATP6 RPS18 RPS3 RPLP1 HLA-C RPL13 MT-ND2 RPS6 RPS27A RPS19 RPL11 EZR RPL21 HLA-A RPL27A RPL31 RPL8 RPLP2 CXCR4 RPL5 RPL34 RPL19 RPL10 RPS4X TMSB4X RPL7 RPL4 RPL32 FTL RPS2 RPLP0 RPL9 RPL18 IGHM RPS11 RPS13 BTG1 RPS12 MT-ND4L RPL15 RPL18A EIF1 COX4I1 RPL37 RPS29 RPS15 RPL6 TNFRSF13C RPL37A HLA-DPB1 HLA-E RPL7A RPS20 RPS16 RPS5 PABPC1 SYNGR2 TXNIP TSC22D3 RPL36 RPSA HLA-DRB1 RPL10A RGS2 RPS8 RPL41 RPS9 RPS3A DDX5 RPS25 UBC RPL14 EEF1B2 RPS7 RPS24 NFKBIA RPL35A MT-ND3 RPL12\n"}]}}

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

Incomplete genetic penetrance and ample phenotypic expressivity in CVID suggest the participation of additional pathogenic mechanisms. Monozygotic MZ twins discordant for CVID are uniquely valuable for studying the contribution of epigenetics to the disease. Here, we generate a single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics census of na\u00efve-to-memory B cell differentiation in a CVID-discordant MZ twin pair. Our analysis identifies DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and transcriptional defects in memory B-cells mirroring defective cell-cell communication upon activation. These findings are validated in a cohort of CVID patients and healthy donors. Our findings provide a comprehensive multi-omics map of alterations in na\u00efve-to-memory B-cell transition in CVID and indicate links between the epigenome and immune cell cross-talk. Our resource, publicly available at the Human Cell Atlas, gives insight into future diagnosis and treatments of CVID patients. DNA methylation alterations in CVID in memory B-cell differentiation To define the DNA methylation profiles in CVID, we performed single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of B cells isolated from a pair of CVID-discordant MZ twins without identified pathogenic mutations. In this study, the use of multi-omics single-cell atlas technologies allowed us to identify functional alterations occurring in specific scarce immune cell populations that would have gone undetected

You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression.

Incomplete genetic penetrance and ample phenotypic expressivity in CVID suggest the participation of additional pathogenic mechanisms. Monozygotic MZ twins discordant for CVID are uniquely valuable for studying the contribution of epigenetics to the disease. Here, we generate a single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics census of na\u00efve-to-memory B cell differentiation in a CVID-discordant MZ twin pair. Our analysis identifies DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and transcriptional defects in memory B-cells mirroring defective cell-cell communication upon activation. These findings are validated in a cohort of CVID patients and healthy donors. Our findings provide a comprehensive multi-omics map of alterations in na\u00efve-to-memory B-cell transition in CVID and indicate links between the epigenome and immune cell cross-talk. Our resource, publicly available at the Human Cell Atlas, gives insight into future diagnosis and treatments of CVID patients. DNA methylation alterations in CVID in memory B-cell differentiation To define the DNA methylation profiles in CVID, we performed single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of B cells isolated from a pair of CVID-discordant MZ twins without identified pathogenic mutations. In this study, the use of multi-omics single-cell atlas technologies allowed us to identify functional alterations occurring in specific scarce immune cell populations that would have gone undetected if conventional bulk-based approaches had been used.\nDataset: Cell Type: mucosal invariant T cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: common variable immunodeficiency, Gene Expression: MT-CO1 MT-CO2 MALAT1 B2M

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

A) Deletion of the SBE1 and SBE5 enhancers leads to a loss of Shh expression and Shh signaling activity in the caudal diencephalon. A high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos To uncover the molecular logic driving the specification of distinct thalamic nuclei, we generated a high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos. Our analysis identified 23 distinct cell populations, comprising most of the known cell types in the caudal diencephalon (Figs. 1D and E). Of note, we found that these data correctly recapitulated the effect of SBE1/5 deletions on the expression of Shh and Shh target genes. Most thalamic nuclei have well-defined molecular identities at E18.5 Gene expression signatures of distinct thalamic nuclei have been described in adult mice or at single stages of embryonic development, but not in a coordinated manner across developmental time 2,25,34,40,41,45.

A) UMAP representation of the mRNA expression data of E18.5 control cells from the post-mitotic cTh.N, rTh.N, ZI, habenula, and reticular complex cell populations. Shared genetic programs across distinct sensory modalities are established during embryogenesis Sensory inputs in the brain follow cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, where first order thalamic nuclei project peripheral sensory inputs onto the primary sensory cortex, and higher order thalamic nuclei receive their input from the primary sensory cortex and project it back to a secondary cortex 19,49,50. Thalamic progenitors are a heterogeneous cell population We next characterized the cellular heterogeneity of the Olig3+ progenitor subpopulation in E12.5 control embryos. Glutamatergic thalamic nuclei emerge sequentially through the coordinated action of three distinct cell lineages To uncover the transcriptomic lineages that relate thalamic progenitors at E12.5 to post-mitotic thalamic neurons at E18.5, we devised a semi-supervised approach for transferring the E12.5 and E18.5 cell annotations across all time points and identified cells with a similar gene expression profile (Methods).

A) UMAP representation and RNA velocity field of the single-cell RNA-seq data of the glutamatergic cell lineage in control embryos at each developmental stage. Each embryonic day was analyzed independently, since neurodevelopmental lineages may change across time as a consequence of shifts in the progenitor identities. Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages.

Locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice We next assessed the consequences that abnormal thalamic development might have on animal behavior in \u0394SBE1/5 mutant mice. \u0394SBE1/5 mice are viable and exhibit reduced locomotor activity and rearing in the open field, as well as a significantly impaired initial coordination and subsequent motor learning on the accelerating rotarod test. The nigrostriatal pathway is a critical component of the basal ganglia motor circuit that degenerates in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. For several reasons, we favor the loss of motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) as a likely explanation for the locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice. Discussion Our study provides a comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of thalamic progenitors and their trajectories into thalamic nuclei during embryonic stages of brain development. The bifurcation of lineage commitments according to thalamic progenitor identity is in general agreement with results from in vivo clonal analyses 33,34. Download figureOpen in new tab . Model of thalamic development. A) Thalamic progenitors are organized rostro-caudally in the neural tube and acquire distinct identities based on their exposure to the Shh morphogen gradient originating from the ZLI and basal plate (top). Consistent with this model, our scRNA-seq analysis also identified heterogeneity in the IPC lineage. The transcriptional profiles of thalamic nuclei at early postnatal stages were previously shown to be more discriminative when classified based on hierarchical order rather than by sensory modality 25. Deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms of thalamic dysfunction in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants provided novel insight into the etiology of a neurodevelopmental movement disorder with a similar phenotype to infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control volitional movement, as well as non-motor functions, and have been implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease and other movement disorders 67\u201370. Motor impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease is caused by the degeneration of dopamine expressing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, favoring activation of iMSNs over dMSNs 71. Recent studies have also implicated the thalamus in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathology 76\u201378. We propose that the motor impairment in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants is attributed to loss of the Shh-dependent cTh.Pro1 subtype of thalamic progenitors, resulting in a reduced number of Olig2+ Sox2+ IPCs and subsequently, fewer cTh.N1 thalamic neurons populating motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) during embryonic development.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MEG3 MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 MT-CO1 MT-CO2 TUBA1A ACTB TUBB2B ACTG1 SNHG11 MT-CYTB NNAT MT-ND4 RTN1 MAP1B BASP1 MT-ND1 TTC3 TUBB5 EEF1A1 MAPT HSP90AA1 NCAM1 STMN2 STMN1 PTMA MARCKS CPE UCHL1 TUBB3 TUBB2A NSG2 MT-ND2 TMSB4X TMSB10 GPM6A HSPA8 HSP90AB1 RPSA RPL41 CELF4 STMN3 GAP43 DPYSL2 PTMS GRIA2 SCD2 CALM1 SOX11 ELAVL3 HMGCS1 RPLP1 YWHAZ STMN4 EEF2 FNBP1L DPYSL3 MAP2 NDN CRMP1 YWHAG RPS8 TUBA1B H3F3B PPIA NRXN3 GPRASP1 PEG3 LY6H GNAS CELF2 CALM2 MAGED1 NREP EIF4G2 CAMTA1 PCSK1N NRXN1 YWHAE RPS15 COX4I1 RTN4 RTN3 GM1673 RPL38 HNRNPA2B1 NSG1 CHL1 MATR3 ZFHX3 ATP9A DCX RPS24 FUS CXADR OLFM1 ELAVL2 PSAP DDX5\nCell Type: glutamatergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MEG3 MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 TUBA1A MT-CO1 MT-CO2 ACTB TUBB2B ACTG1 MT-CYTB MT-ND4 MAP1B MT-ND1 RTN1 EEF1A1 TUBB5 TCF7L2 BASP1 TUBB3 NNAT MAPT HSP90AA1 TTC3 PTMA CELF2 MARCKS STMN2 STMN1 NCAM1 UCHL1 MT-ND2 NREP HSP90AB1 TMSB4X CPE PTMS SNHG11 RPL41 RPSA TUBB2A STMN3 TMSB10 ELAVL3 NSG2 EEF2 HSPA8 HMGCS1 DPYSL3 SOX11 YWHAZ CRMP1 SCD2 DPYSL2 RPLP1 EIF4G2 GAP43 MAP2 STMN4 NRXN1 RPS15 FNBP1L GPM6A YWHAG JUND SOX4 RPS8 GNAS RPL38 ZFHX3 PPIA YWHAE CALM1 GRIA2 DCX HNRNPA2B1 CELF4 RTN4 TPT1 H3F3B COX4I1 JPT1 RPL8 RPS24 TUBA1B DDX5 CADM2 MYL6 DCLK1 KITL MT-ND3 ZIC1 KIF1B RTN3 GM1673 PTPRS CAMTA1 PTN GNB1 SELENOW\n"}]}}

Thalamic progenitors are a heterogeneous cell population We next characterized the cellular heterogeneity of the Olig3+ progenitor subpopulation in E12.5 control embryos. Glutamatergic thalamic nuclei emerge sequentially through the coordinated action of three distinct cell lineages To uncover the transcriptomic lineages that relate thalamic progenitors at E12.5 to post-mitotic thalamic neurons at E18.5, we devised a semi-supervised approach for transferring the E12.5 and E18.5 cell annotations across all time points and identified cells with a similar gene expression profile (Methods).

A) UMAP representation and RNA velocity field of the single-cell RNA-seq data of the glutamatergic cell lineage in control embryos at each developmental stage. Each embryonic day was analyzed independently, since neurodevelopmental lineages may change across time as a consequence of shifts in the progenitor identities. Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages.

Locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice We next assessed the consequences that abnormal thalamic development might have on animal behavior in \u0394SBE1/5 mutant mice. \u0394SBE1/5 mice are viable and exhibit reduced locomotor activity and rearing in the open field, as well as a significantly impaired initial coordination and subsequent motor learning on the accelerating rotarod test. The nigrostriatal pathway is a critical component of the basal ganglia motor circuit that degenerates in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. For several reasons, we favor the loss of motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) as a likely explanation for the locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice. Discussion Our study provides a comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of thalamic progenitors and their trajectories into thalamic nuclei during embryonic stages of brain development.

Model of thalamic development. A) Thalamic progenitors are organized rostro-caudally in the neural tube and acquire distinct identities based on their exposure to the Shh morphogen gradient originating from the ZLI and basal plate (top). Consistent with this model, our scRNA-seq analysis also identified heterogeneity in the IPC lineage. The transcriptional profiles of thalamic nuclei at early postnatal stages were previously shown to be more discriminative when classified based on hierarchical order rather than by sensory modality 25. Deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms of thalamic dysfunction in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants provided novel insight into the etiology of a neurodevelopmental movement disorder with a similar phenotype to infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control volitional movement, as well as non-motor functions, and have been implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease and other movement disorders 67\u201370. Motor impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease is caused by the degeneration of dopamine expressing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, favoring activation of iMSNs over dMSNs 71. Recent studies have also implicated the thalamus in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathology 76\u201378. We propose that the motor impairment in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants is attributed to loss of the Shh-dependent cTh.Pro1 subtype of thalamic progenitors, resulting in a reduced number of Olig2+ Sox2+ IPCs and subsequently, fewer cTh.N1 thalamic neurons populating motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) during embryonic development.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TUBA1A TMSB4X MT-ATP6 MT-CO3 EEF1A1 PTMA MT-CO2 STMN1 RPL13 RPS8 H3F3B TUBB2B H3F3A HSP90AB1 TPT1 ACTG1 NNAT RPS24 FTL1 TUBB5 RPSA RPS27A ACTB CKB RPL23 FAU RPS14 RPS11 RPL41 RPS10 RPS9 RPL27A MT-CO1 RPL11 RPL8 RPL18A RPL15 RPL19 RPS3A1 BASP1 RPL9 RPS15A UBB RPLP1 RPL6 RPL30 RPL24 RPS20 TMSB10 RPS4X RPS29 RPS13 RPL32 RPS23 RPLP0 RPL28 RPS3 RPS19 RPL37A RPL18 MT-CYTB RPS7 SOX4 RPS2 PPIA RPL35A RPS26 RPS16 RPS18 RPL34 EIF1 RPS5 SOX11 PRDX2 RPL7 RPL37 RPL17 TUBB3 CHCHD2 HSPA8 RPL3 RACK1 NACA XIST PPP1R14B RPS12 MARCKS RPLP2 DDX5 HSP90AA1 CFL1 RPL14 MT-ND2 RPL5 HNRNPA2B1 RPL36 RPL26 NPM1 RPL10A\nCell Type: glutamatergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TUBA1A STMN1 MT-ATP6 MT-CO3 TMSB4X PTMA ACTG1 MT-CO2 EEF1A1 TUBB2B H3F3B H3F3A TUBB5 TPT1 ACTB BASP1 FTL1 HSP90AB1 NNAT RPS8 RPL13 TUBB3 MT-CO1 TCF7L2 TMSB10 RPS24 UBB FAU RPS27A SOX4 MT-CYTB RPS10 RPS11 RPSA RPS14 RPL23 RPL18A RPL11 RPS9 RPL41 RPL15 RPL19 RTN1 PPIA RPL27A HSPA8 PRDX2 RPS15A RPL6 RPS23 RPL24 RPS29 RPL8 RPL30 SOX11 RPS13 RPS3A1 RPS4X RPL9 RPL28 RPS7 CALM1 RPL32 MAP1B EIF1 RPS26 RPS19 RPS16 CFL1 RPS20 RPLP0 RPL18 STMN2 RPS5 RPL34 RPLP1 HSP90AA1 XIST DDX5 RPL37 RPS3 RPL37A RPL17 RPL7 RPS18 HNRNPA2B1 MT-ND4 RPL35A MT-ND1 CHCHD2 GAP43 COX4I1 MT-ND2 RPL3 PPP1R14B MARCKS RACK1 EIF4A1 JPT1\nCell Type: neural progenitor cell, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TMSB4X TUBA1A PTMA MT-ATP6 MT-CO3 EEF1A1 MT-CO2 RPS8 RPL13 STMN1 ACTG1 TPT1 TUBB5 RPSA H2AZ1 H3F3B RPS24 HSP90AB1 H3F3A PPIA RPS27A ACTB RPS10 RPL41 FAU RPL23 RPL8 RPS11 RPL11 RPLP1 RPS9 TUBB2B RPS20 RPS14 RPS3A1 RPS4X RPL19 RPL27A RPL18A RPS19 RPS15A MT-CO1 FTL1 RPL15 RPS16 RPL32 RPS2 RPL6 RPLP0 RPL18 RPL30 RPS23 RPL9 RPS29 HMGB1 RPS13 RPL28 RPS3 RPL24 RPS18 UBB RPS5 RPS26 HMGB2 RPL3 HSPA8 MT-CYTB BASP1 RPL37A RPS7 HSP90AA1 CKB RPL35A RPL14 RPL34 RPL37 NPM1 RAN RPL17 RPL7 EIF1 GAPDH HNRNPA2B1 RPS12 VIM PRDX2 RACK1 FABP7 RPS15 RPL10A RPLP2 YBX1 NACA MARCKS TMSB10 RPL26 NNAT SUMO2 TUBA1B\n"}]}}

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages.

Locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice We next assessed the consequences that abnormal thalamic development might have on animal behavior in \u0394SBE1/5 mutant mice. \u0394SBE1/5 mice are viable and exhibit reduced locomotor activity and rearing in the open field, as well as a significantly impaired initial coordination and subsequent motor learning on the accelerating rotarod test. The nigrostriatal pathway is a critical component of the basal ganglia motor circuit that degenerates in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. For several reasons, we favor the loss of motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) as a likely explanation for the locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice. Discussion Our study provides a comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of thalamic progenitors and their trajectories into thalamic nuclei during embryonic stages of brain development. The bifurcation of lineage commitments according to thalamic progenitor identity is in general agreement with results from in vivo clonal analyses 33,34. Download figureOpen in new tab . Model of thalamic development. A) Thalamic progenitors are organized rostro-caudally in the neural tube and acquire distinct identities based on their exposure to the Shh morphogen gradient originating from the ZLI and basal plate (top). Consistent with this model, our scRNA-seq analysis also identified heterogeneity in the IPC lineage. The transcriptional profiles of thalamic nuclei at early postnatal stages were previously shown to be more discriminative when classified based on hierarchical order rather than by sensory modality 25. Deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms of thalamic dysfunction in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants provided novel insight into the etiology of a neurodevelopmental movement disorder with a similar phenotype to infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control volitional movement, as well as non-motor functions, and have been implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease and other movement disorders 67\u201370. Motor impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease is caused by the degeneration of dopamine expressing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, favoring activation of iMSNs over dMSNs 71. Recent studies have also implicated the thalamus in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathology 76\u201378. We propose that the motor impairment in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants is attributed to loss of the Shh-dependent cTh.Pro1 subtype of thalamic progenitors, resulting in a reduced number of Olig2+ Sox2+ IPCs and subsequently, fewer cTh.N1 thalamic neurons populating motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) during embryonic development.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression:

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

A) Deletion of the SBE1 and SBE5 enhancers leads to a loss of Shh expression and Shh signaling activity in the caudal diencephalon. A high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos To uncover the molecular logic driving the specification of distinct thalamic nuclei, we generated a high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos. Our analysis identified 23 distinct cell populations, comprising most of the known cell types in the caudal diencephalon (Figs. 1D and E). Of note, we found that these data correctly recapitulated the effect of SBE1/5 deletions on the expression of Shh and Shh target genes. Most thalamic nuclei have well-defined molecular identities at E18.5 Gene expression signatures of distinct thalamic nuclei have been described in adult mice or at single stages of embryonic development, but not in a coordinated manner across developmental time 2,25,34,40,41,45.

A) UMAP representation of the mRNA expression data of E18.5 control cells from the post-mitotic cTh.N, rTh.N, ZI, habenula, and reticular complex cell populations. Shared genetic programs across distinct sensory modalities are established during embryogenesis Sensory inputs in the brain follow cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, where first order thalamic nuclei project peripheral sensory inputs onto the primary sensory cortex, and higher order thalamic nuclei receive their input from the primary sensory cortex and project it back to a secondary cortex 19,49,50. Thalamic progenitors are a heterogeneous cell population We next characterized the cellular heterogeneity of the Olig3+ progenitor subpopulation in E12.5 control embryos. Glutamatergic thalamic nuclei emerge sequentially through the coordinated action of three distinct cell lineages To uncover the transcriptomic lineages that relate thalamic progenitors at E12.5 to post-mitotic thalamic neurons at E18.5, we devised a semi-supervised approach for transferring the E12.5 and E18.5 cell annotations across all time points and identified cells with a similar gene expression profile (Methods).

A) UMAP representation and RNA velocity field of the single-cell RNA-seq data of the glutamatergic cell lineage in control embryos at each developmental stage. Each embryonic day was analyzed independently, since neurodevelopmental lineages may change across time as a consequence of shifts in the progenitor identities. Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages.

For several reasons, we favor the loss of motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) as a likely explanation for the locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice.

Deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms of thalamic dysfunction in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants provided novel insight into the etiology of a neurodevelopmental movement disorder with a similar phenotype to infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease.

Recent studies have also implicated the thalamus in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathology 76\u201378.

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

A) Deletion of the SBE1 and SBE5 enhancers leads to a loss of Shh expression and Shh signaling activity in the caudal diencephalon. A high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos To uncover the molecular logic driving the specification of distinct thalamic nuclei, we generated a high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos. Our analysis identified 23 distinct cell populations, comprising most of the known cell types in the caudal diencephalon (Figs. 1D and E). Of note, we found that these data correctly recapitulated the effect of SBE1/5 deletions on the expression of Shh and Shh target genes. Most thalamic nuclei have well-defined molecular identities at E18.5 Gene expression signatures of distinct thalamic nuclei have been described in adult mice or at single stages of embryonic development, but not in a coordinated manner across developmental time 2,25,34,40,41,45.

A) UMAP representation of the mRNA expression data of E18.5 control cells from the post-mitotic cTh.N, rTh.N, ZI, habenula, and reticular complex cell populations. Shared genetic programs across distinct sensory modalities are established during embryogenesis Sensory inputs in the brain follow cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, where first order thalamic nuclei project peripheral sensory inputs onto the primary sensory cortex, and higher order thalamic nuclei receive their input from the primary sensory cortex and project it back to a secondary cortex 19,49,50. Thalamic progenitors are a heterogeneous cell population We next characterized the cellular heterogeneity of the Olig3+ progenitor subpopulation in E12.5 control embryos. Glutamatergic thalamic nuclei emerge sequentially through the coordinated action of three distinct cell lineages To uncover the transcriptomic lineages that relate thalamic progenitors at E12.5 to post-mitotic thalamic neurons at E18.5, we devised a semi-supervised approach for transferring the E12.5 and E18.5 cell annotations across all time points and identified cells with a similar gene expression profile (Methods). Download figureOpen in new tab . Glutamatergic thalamic cell lineages regionalize the thalamus into distinct molecular domains. A) UMAP representation and RNA velocity field of the single-cell RNA-seq data of the glutamatergic cell lineage in control embryos at each developmental stage. Each embryonic day was analyzed independently, since neurodevelopmental lineages may change across time as a consequence of shifts in the progenitor identities. Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages. Shh signaling is required for rTh.Pro and cTh.Pro1 progenitor specification and expansion The inference of developmental trajectories from unperturbed single-cell transcriptomic data has proven to be misleading in some situations 55.

Nkx2-2 and Sox2 expressing thalamic nuclei are reduced in \u0394SBE1/5 mice Based on our model of thalamic development, the observed depletion of cTh.Pro1 progenitors in \u0394SBE1/5 embryos should lead to a failure in the development of Sox2-expressing cTh.N1 thalamic nuclei.

Locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice We next assessed the consequences that abnormal thalamic development might have on animal behavior in \u0394SBE1/5 mutant mice. \u0394SBE1/5 mice are viable and exhibit reduced locomotor activity and rearing in the open field, as well as a significantly impaired initial coordination and subsequent motor learning on the accelerating rotarod test. The nigrostriatal pathway is a critical component of the basal ganglia motor circuit that degenerates in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. For several reasons, we favor the loss of motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) as a likely explanation for the locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice. Discussion Our study provides a comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of thalamic progenitors and their trajectories into thalamic nuclei during embryonic stages of brain development.

The aetiology of this complex disease is dependent on the interplay of multiple heterogeneous cell types in the pancreatic environment. Here, we provide a single-cell atlas of pancreatic islets of 24 T1D, autoantibody-positive and nondiabetic organ donors across multiple quantitative modalities including 80,000 cells using single-cell transcriptomics, 7,000,000 cells using cytometry by time of flight and 1,000,000 cells using in situ imaging mass cytometry. We develop an advanced integrative analytical strategy to assess pancreatic islets and identify canonical cell types. We show that a subset of exocrine ductal cells acquires a signature of tolerogenic dendritic cells in an apparent attempt at immune suppression in T1D donors. Our multimodal analyses delineate cell types and processes that may contribute to T1D immunopathogenesis and provide an integrative procedure for exploration and discovery of human pancreatic function. Single-cell RNA sequencing unravels novel cell states in the human pancreas To unmask the molecular perturbations occurring in pancreatic tissues during T1D, we constructed 81,313 single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq libraries from pancreatic islets of 24 human organ donors representing three categories: individuals with T1D n  5, those with AAbs towards pancreatic islet proteins but no clinical diagnosis of T1D AAb; n  8 and those with neither AAbs nor a history of T1D control; n  11;, Extended Data,b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Using three high-throughput single-cell technologies, we provided a comprehensive atlas of millions of cells using integrative multimodal analyses as a molecular microscope to investigate cellular diversity in the pancreas of T1D, AAb and nondiabetic human organ donors.\nDataset: Cell Type: pancreatic D cell, Tissue: islet of Langerhans, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: SST MALAT1 INS MT-CO2

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

Here, we study the differentiation state and cellular origin of 1300 childhood and adult kidney tumors. Using single cell mRNA reference maps of normal tissues, we quantify reference cellular signals in each tumor. Quantifying global differentiation, we find that childhood tumors exhibit fetal cellular signals, replacing the presumption of fetalness with a quantitative measure of immaturity. By contrast, in adult cancers our assessment refutes the suggestion of dedifferentiation towards a fetal state in most cases. We find an intimate connection between developmental mesenchymal populations and childhood renal tumors. We demonstrate the diagnostic potential of our approach with a case study of a cryptic renal tumor. Our findings provide a cellular definition of human renal tumors through an approach that is broadly applicable to human cancer. An integrated single cell reference map of the kidney The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and together with its associated vasculature and support cells make up the majority of kidney cells. We have determined normal cell signals in the major types of human renal tumors.\nDataset: Cell Type: epithelial cell of glomerular capsule, Tissue: kidney, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TMSB4X MT-CO1

We have generated dense single-cell and spatial reference maps of the human uterus and three-dimensional endometrial organoid cultures. We dissect the signaling pathways that determine cell fate of the epithelial lineages in the lumenal and glandular microenvironments. Our benchmark of the endometrial organoids reveals the pathways and cell states regulating differentiation of the secretory and ciliated lineages both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro downregulation of WNT or NOTCH pathways increases the differentiation efficiency along the secretory and ciliated lineages, respectively. We utilize our cellular maps to deconvolute bulk data from endometrial cancers and endometriotic lesions, illuminating the cell types dominating in each of these disorders. These mechanistic insights provide a platform for future development of treatments for common conditions including endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma. A single-cell map of the full-thickness human uterus To generate a cellular map of the human endometrium that accounts for the temporal and spatial changes across the menstrual cycle, uterine samples were analyzed by single-cell transcriptomicssingle-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA sequencing snRNA-seqalongside spatial transcriptomics methods 10x Genomics Visium slides and high-resolution microscopy and Extended Data. Profiling the uterus in space and time is essential to define the cell states and signaling pathways of normal human endometrium.\nDataset: Cell Type: ciliated cell, Tissue: uterus, Gene Expression:

However, excessive cost and a lack of strategies for the purification of newly identified cell types impede their functional characterization and large-scale profiling. Here, we have generated high-content single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps of human blood and bone marrow that quantitatively link the expression of up to 197 surface markers to cellular identities and biological processes across all main hematopoietic cell types in healthy aging and leukemia. These reference maps enable the automatic design of cost-effective high-throughput cytometry schemes that outperform state-of-the-art approaches, accurately reflect complex topologies of cellular systems and permit the purification of precisely defined cell states. The systematic integration of cytometry and proteo-genomic data enables the functional capacities of precisely mapped cell states to be measured at the single-cell level. Our study serves as an accessible resource and paves the way for a data-driven era in cytometry. A single-cell proteo-genomic reference map of BM To establish a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic and surface protein expression map of human BM, we performed a series of Abseq experiments in which mononuclear BM cells from hip aspirates were labeled with 97197 oligo-tagged antibodies, followed by targeted or whole transcriptome scRNA-seq on the BD Rhapsody platform. In this study, we have demonstrated the power of single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps for the design and analysis of cytometry experiments.\nDataset: Cell Type: conventional dendritic cell,

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

However, excessive cost and a lack of strategies for the purification of newly identified cell types impede their functional characterization and large-scale profiling. Here, we have generated high-content single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps of human blood and bone marrow that quantitatively link the expression of up to 197 surface markers to cellular identities and biological processes across all main hematopoietic cell types in healthy aging and leukemia. These reference maps enable the automatic design of cost-effective high-throughput cytometry schemes that outperform state-of-the-art approaches, accurately reflect complex topologies of cellular systems and permit the purification of precisely defined cell states. The systematic integration of cytometry and proteo-genomic data enables the functional capacities of precisely mapped cell states to be measured at the single-cell level. Our study serves as an accessible resource and paves the way for a data-driven era in cytometry. A single-cell proteo-genomic reference map of BM To establish a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic and surface protein expression map of human BM, we performed a series of Abseq experiments in which mononuclear BM cells from hip aspirates were labeled with 97197 oligo-tagged antibodies, followed by targeted or whole transcriptome scRNA-seq on the BD Rhapsody platform. In this study, we have demonstrated the power of single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps for the design and analysis of cytometry experiments.\nDataset: Cell Type: hematopoietic multipotent

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word. Strictly format like this: \n<|Context|>the context<|Question|>the content of the question<|Answer|>the content of the answer<|Keyword|>the answer keywords\n<|Context|>the context<|Question|>the content of the question<|Answer|>the content of the answer<|Keyword|>the answer keywords\n...\n\nManuscript: Single-cell genomics technology has transformed our understanding of complex cellular systems. However, excessive cost and a lack of strategies for the purification of newly identified cell types impede their functional characterization and large-scale profiling. Here, we have generated high-content single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps of human blood and bone marrow that quantitatively link the expression of up to 197 surface markers to cellular identities and biological processes across all main hematopoietic cell types in healthy aging and leukemia. These reference maps enable the automatic design of cost-effective high-throughput cytometry schemes that outperform state-of-the-art approaches, accurately reflect complex topologies of cellular systems and permit the purification of precisely defined cell states. The systematic integration of cytometry and proteo-genomic data enables the functional capacities of precisely mapped cell states to be measured at the single-cell level. Our study serves as an accessible resource and paves the way for a data-driven era in cytometry. A single-cell proteo-genomic reference map of BM To establish a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic and surface protein expression map of human BM, we performed a series of Abseq experiments in which mononuclear BM cells from hip aspirates were labeled with 97197 oligo-tagged antibodies, followed by targeted or whole transcriptome scRNA-seq on the BD Rhapsody platform. In this study, we have demonstrated the power of single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps for the design and analysis of cytometry experiments.\nDataset: Cell Type: early promyelocyte, Tissue: bone

There is a knowledge gap in the investigation of key driver cells of HB in tumor. Here we show single cell ribonucleic acid sequencing scRNAseq analysis of human tumor, background liver, and patient derived xenograft PDX to demonstrate gene expression patterns within tumor and to identify intratumor cell subtype heterogeneity to define differing roles in pathogenesis based on intracellular signaling in pediatric HB. We have identified a driver tumor cell cluster in HB by genetic expression which can be examined to define disease mechanism and treatments. Identification of both critical mechanistic pathways combined with unique cell populations provide the basis for discovery and investigation of novel treatment strategies in vitro and in vivo. PDX model mimics HB tumor expression and histology In the PDX models we have generated, patient tumors share genetic and histologic characteristics with PDX tumors. and b demonstrates the experimental workflow from primary tumor and liver collection through pathway and tumor subclustering analyses. Utilizing scRNAseq, we have clearly defined cell populations from tumor and PDX from HB patients in contrast to the cell clusters representative of normal liver identified from background liver.\nDataset: Cell Type: B cell, Tissue: liver, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 ALB FTL NEAT1 APOA2 APOB GPC3 APOA1 PARD3B SERPINA1 TSHZ2 FGB RELN FGA FGL1 FNDC3B LRMDA AHSG APOE ITPR2

Here, we study the differentiation state and cellular origin of 1300 childhood and adult kidney tumors. Using single cell mRNA reference maps of normal tissues, we quantify reference cellular signals in each tumor. Quantifying global differentiation, we find that childhood tumors exhibit fetal cellular signals, replacing the presumption of fetalness with a quantitative measure of immaturity. By contrast, in adult cancers our assessment refutes the suggestion of dedifferentiation towards a fetal state in most cases. We find an intimate connection between developmental mesenchymal populations and childhood renal tumors. We demonstrate the diagnostic potential of our approach with a case study of a cryptic renal tumor. Our findings provide a cellular definition of human renal tumors through an approach that is broadly applicable to human cancer. An integrated single cell reference map of the kidney The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and together with its associated vasculature and support cells make up the majority of kidney cells. We have determined normal cell signals in the major types of human renal tumors.\nDataset: Cell Type: epithelial cell of nephron, Tissue: kidney, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-ATP6 MT-CO2 MT-ND1 MT-ND3 MT-ND4 MT-CYB EEF1A1 IGF2 RPL41 PTMA RPL13 RPL30 RPL3 RPS18 RPL6 MT-ND2 RPS2 RPLP1 RPS27 RPL10 RPL11 RPS19 RPL37A RPL7A RPL8 RPS24 H3-3A ACTG1 RPS14 TPT1 RPL32 RPS12 RPS23 GAPDH RPS4X RPS3A RPL35A RPL37 RPS28 MDK RPL39 RPL19 RPS7 MT-ND5 RPS15 RPS21 RPS3 RPL15 RPL34 RPS27A RPS15A RPL18A RPL28 RPL5 RPS9 HMGB1 TMSB10 RPS8 RPL18 RPL23A MTRNR2L12 RPS29 RPL36 HNRNPA1 H3-3B RPL26 RPL29 RPL9 RPLP2 RPS6 RPL14 RPL7 RPL21 NACA RPL10A RPL24 RPS11 RPLP0 RPL27A RACK1 RPL22 COL2A1 RPS16 RPL35 FTH1 TUBA1B RPS5 IGFBP2 RPL12 ACTB HSP90AA1 RPSA RPL13A GNAS HNRNPA2B1 HSP90AB1 XIST\nCell Type: leukocyte, Tissue: kidney, Gene Expression: MALAT1 FTL MT-CO1 TMSB4X MT-ND3 MT-ATP6 MT-ND4 MT-CO2 MT-CO3 B2M MT-ND1 MT-CYB RPLP1 RPS27 TPT1 ACTB EEF1A1 RPL13 FTH1 MT-ND2 RPL10 RPL41 MTRNR2L12 TMSB10 RPS18 RPS12 RPL28 RPL39 RPS28 RPS19 MT-ND5 RPS24 RPL37 RPL37A RPL11 RPS29 PTMA RPS2 RPS23 RPS14 RPL32 RPL30 RPL34 NEAT1 RPL19 VIM RPL26 RPS15A RPL15 RPS15 RPS3 RPS4X RPL36 RPS27A HLA-A RPS9 FAU RPLP2 RPS8 GAPDH RPS6 RPL7A RPS3A RPL18A RPL3 RPS7 RPL21 PSAP RPS21 HLA-B RPL29 RPL12 RPL27A RPL18 RPL9 RPL8 RPL13A ATP5F1E RPL6 HLA-DRA RPL35 S100A11 CD74 RPL38 S100A4 SAT1 RPL23A EIF1 RPL14 RPL35A RPL5 ACTG1 SERF2 H3-3A RPL22 OAZ1 RPL24 RPS13 CTSD H3-3B\nCell Type: mesenchymal stem cell, Tissue: kidney, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 RPS18 MGP RPL13 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 RPL41 RPL10 RPS2 RPL30 TPT1 RPLP1 RPL37A RPS19 RPS8 MT-ND3 RPS27 MT-ND4 RPL32 RPS23 RPL11 RPL37 RPL6 RPS12 RPS24 RPS14 RPS4X MT-CO2 RPL34 RPS28 RPL7A COL1A1 RPS7 IGF2 MT-CYB RPL39 RPL3 MT-ND1 RPS15A COL3A1 RPS15 ACTG1 RPL28 RPL35A VIM RPS3A RPS3 RPL18 RPL8 RPL9 TMSB10 RPS27A RPL19 RPL15 RPL26 RPL36 RPS29 RPL23A RPL24 RPL18A RPL29 RPL5 RPL21 RPL14 RPL10A RPL12 RPS9 RPS6 NACA RPL27A RPL7 RPLP0 RPL13A RPLP2 PTMA RPS11 RACK1 RPS16 ACTB GAPDH TMSB4X RPS21 FTL MT-ND2 RPL35 RPL23 RPS13 RPS25 RPL22 FTH1 RPS5 H3-3A FAU RPL38 MT-ND5 LGALS1 RPSA DCN\nCell Type: native cell, Tissue: kidney, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-CO2 MT-ATP6 MT-ND4 EEF1A1 MT-CYB RPS18 RPL13 MT-ND3 RPS2 MT-ND1 RPS19 RPS14 RPS12 RPL11 TPT1 RPLP1 RPL7A RPL10 RPL32 VIM RPS4X RPS3 RPS24 RPS23 RPL3 RPL41 RPS3A RPS8 RPS15 RPS7 RPL29 RPL6 RPL15 RPL30 RPL19 RPS15A RPL18 MT-ND2 RPL37 RPS27A RPL34 RPS27 ACTG1 RPL8 PTMA RPL37A RPL35A RPS9 RPS6 RPL18A RPL28 RPL26 RPL39 RPL13A RPL5 RPL12 RPL24 GAPDH RPS28 RPL23A RPL9 H3-3A RPS16 RACK1 RPL36 MT-ND5 RPL21 RPL35 TMSB10 HSP90AA1 RPL27A RPS13 NACA RPL10A RPL14 FTH1 RPL7 ACTB RPS5 RPLP2 RPS11 RPS29 RPS21 RPSA FAU HSP90AB1 RPS25 RPLP0 TUBA1B RPL22 HMGB1 TUBA1A RPL27 UBA52 RPL23 FTL RPL4\n"}]}}

We have generated dense single-cell and spatial reference maps of the human uterus and three-dimensional endometrial organoid cultures. We dissect the signaling pathways that determine cell fate of the epithelial lineages in the lumenal and glandular microenvironments. Our benchmark of the endometrial organoids reveals the pathways and cell states regulating differentiation of the secretory and ciliated lineages both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro downregulation of WNT or NOTCH pathways increases the differentiation efficiency along the secretory and ciliated lineages, respectively. We utilize our cellular maps to deconvolute bulk data from endometrial cancers and endometriotic lesions, illuminating the cell types dominating in each of these disorders. These mechanistic insights provide a platform for future development of treatments for common conditions including endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma.

We performed single nucleus ATAC snATAC-seq and RNA snRNA-seq sequencing to generate paired, cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles of the adult human kidney. We demonstrate that snATAC-seq is comparable to snRNA-seq in the assignment of cell identity and can further refine our understanding of functional heterogeneity in the nephron. The majority of differentially accessible chromatin regions are localized to promoters and a significant proportion are closely associated with differentially expressed genes. Cell-type-specific enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs implicates the activation of NF-\u03baB that promotes VCAM1 expression and drives transition between a subpopulation of proximal tubule epithelial cells. Our multi-omics approach improves the ability to detect unique cell states within the kidney and redefines cellular heterogeneity in the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb. Single-cell transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiling in the adult human kidney snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq were performed on five healthy adult kidney samples. We performed snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq sequencing in parallel to describe the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility landscape of the adult human kidney.\nDataset: Cell Type: epithelial cell of

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word. Strictly format like this: \n<|Context|>the context<|Question|>the content of the question<|Answer|>the content of the answer<|Keyword|>the answer keywords\n<|Context|>the context<|Question|>the content of the question<|Answer|>the content of the answer<|Keyword|>the answer keywords\n...\n\nManuscript: The integration of single cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility datasets enables a deeper understanding of cell heterogeneity. We performed single nucleus ATAC snATAC-seq and RNA snRNA-seq sequencing to generate paired, cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles of the adult human kidney. We demonstrate that snATAC-seq is comparable to snRNA-seq in the assignment of cell identity and can further refine our understanding of functional heterogeneity in the nephron. The majority of differentially accessible chromatin regions are localized to promoters and a significant proportion are closely associated with differentially expressed genes. Cell-type-specific enrichment of transcription factor binding motifs implicates the activation of NF-\u03baB that promotes VCAM1 expression and drives transition between a subpopulation of proximal tubule epithelial cells. Our multi-omics approach improves the ability to detect unique cell states within the kidney and redefines cellular heterogeneity in the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb. Single-cell transcriptional and chromatin accessibility profiling in the adult human kidney snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq were performed on five healthy adult kidney samples. We performed snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq sequencing in parallel to describe the transcriptional and chromatin accessibility landscape of the adult human kidney.\nDataset: Cell Type: connective tissue

In the present study, we found age-related alterations of oligodendrocyte cell state with a reduction in total oligodendrocyte density in aging murine white matter. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identified interferon IFN-responsive oligodendrocytes, which localize in proximity to CD8 T cells in aging white matter. Absence of functional lymphocytes decreased the number of IFN-responsive oligodendrocytes and rescued oligodendrocyte loss, whereas T-cell checkpoint inhibition worsened the aging response. In addition, we identified a subpopulation of lymphocyte-dependent, IFN-responsive microglia in the vicinity of the CD8 T cells in aging white matter. In summary, we provide evidence that CD8 T-cell-induced, IFN-responsive oligodendrocytes and microglia are important modifiers of white matter aging. Transcriptomic aging responses of oligodendrocytes To characterize the oligodendrocyte aging effect at single-cell resolution, we used two different single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq methods. White matter aging causes myelin degeneration, but how oligodendrocytes respond to aging is poorly defined.\nDataset: Cell Type: microglial cell, Tissue: brain gray matter, Gene Expression: CST3 MALAT1 TMSB4X C1QA HEXB ACTB C1QB C1QC CTSS CTSD ITM2B MT-CO3 RPS29 MT-ATP6 RPLP1 CX3CR1 EEF1A1 MT-CO1 FAU TPT1 LGMN MT-CO2 FTH1 MT-CYTB MARCKS CD81 SPARC TYROBP P2RY12 CSF1R FCER1G RPS24 TREM2 RPS12 RPS21 RPS9 RPL13 RPL39 RPL27A SERINC3 MT-ND4 LAPTM5 RPL23 RPL37A RPL30 RPL37 RPL35A RPL18A RPS8 RPL21 PSAP RPS27A RPS11 MT-ND1 RPL10 SELPLG CTSB FTL1 RPS4X B2M RPS27 RPS23 RPL6 RPL41 CTSZ RPS3A1 RPS15A SIGLECH GPR34 RPL17 RPS10 RPS14 RPS16 RPL19 MT-ND2 CD9 RGS10 RPS20 LY86 DDX5 RPL34 RPL32 RPL26 RPL11 RPLP2 FCRLS RPS13 RPL9 MEF2C CTSL PPIA RPS3 RPS7 SELENOP UBB RPL12 RPLP0 RPS25 LPCAT2 LAMP1\nCell Type: microglial cell, Tissue: brain white matter, Gene Expression: CST3 MALAT1 TMSB4X C1QA C1QB CTSS HEXB ACTB C1QC CTSD APOE FTH1 ITM2B RPS29 MT-CO3 EEF1A1 RPLP1 FAU MT-ATP6 MT-CO1 TPT1 MT-CO2 RPS24 TYROBP RPS12 RPL23 CD81 RPL13 RPL39 MT-CYTB RPL27A RPS21 FCER1G RPL37A CX3CR1 RPS9 TREM2 RPS8 RPL30 FTL1 LGMN RPL35A B2M RPL37 RPS27A RPL21 RPL41 RPL18A RPS11 RPS4X CTSB CD9 CTSZ RPS10 RPS3A1 RPS15A SPARC RPL32 RPS16 RPL19 RPS23 RPL6 RPS14 RPS20 CSF1R RPL17 MT-ND4 RPS27 RPL10 MARCKS RPL34 LY86 PSAP RPL26 RPL11 LAPTM5 RPS28 MT-ND1 RPLP2 RPL9 RPS13 RPLP0 RPS7 CTSL SERINC3 RPS3 RPL28 RPS5 RPS19 RPS18 RPL12 PPIA RPS25 RPL38 RPL3 RPS2 RPSA RPL10A RPS26 MT-ND2\n"}]}}

Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human and mouse neocortex show an increased diversity of glutamatergic neuron types in supragranular layers in human neocortex and pronounced gradients as a function of cortical depth3. Here, to probe the functional and anatomical correlates of this transcriptomic diversity, we developed a robust platform combining patch clamp recording, biocytin staining and single-cell RNA-sequencing Patch-seq to examine neurosurgically resected human tissues. We demonstrate a strong correspondence between morphological, physiological and transcriptomic phenotypes of five human glutamatergic supragranular neuron types. These were enriched in but not restricted to layers, with one type varying continuously in all phenotypes across layers 2 and 3. The deep portion of layer 3 contained highly distinctive cell types, two of which express a neurofilament protein that labels long-range projection neurons in primates that are selectively depleted in Alzheimers disease4,5. Together, these results demonstrate the explanatory power of transcriptomic cell-type classification, provide a structural underpinning for increased complexity of cortical function in humans, and implicate discrete transcriptomic neuron types as selectively vulnerable in disease. Greater neuronal diversity in human neocortex We used histology to compare the density and size of neurons from the human middle temporal gyrus MTG, the most accessible region from neurosurgery, with two neocortical areas in mouse: the extensively characterized primary visual cortex VISp25,26 and the temporal association area TEa, which is often used as a comparator for MTG16,19,33. Human neocortical cellular diversity has been difficult to define quantitatively in part owing to underpowered analyses with low-throughput techniques because of limited tissue access, high variation across individuals and the absence of cell-type-selective tools. snRNA-seq can be applied to any species including human, where it forms the basis of a quantitative hierarchical cellular taxonomy that mirrors many aspects of cellular cytoarchitecture, function and developmental origins.\nDataset: Cell Type: glutamatergic neuron, Tissue: frontal cortex, Disease: brain neoplasm, Gene Expression:

Despite recent progress in single-cell technologies, a unified catalog and molecular characterization of the heterogeneous cell types and, specifically, neuronal subtypes in this brain region are still lacking. Here, we present an integrated reference atlas, HypoMap, of the murine hypothalamus, consisting of 384,925 cells, with the ability to incorporate new additional experiments. We validate HypoMap by comparing data collected from Smart-SeqFluidigm C1 and bulk RNA sequencing of selected neuronal cell types with different degrees of cellular heterogeneity. Finally, via HypoMap, we identify classes of neurons expressing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor Glp1r and prepronociceptin Pnoc, and validate them using single-molecule in situ hybridization. Collectively, HypoMap provides a unified framework for the systematic functional annotation of murine hypothalamic cell types, and it can serve as an important platform to unravel the functional organization of hypothalamic neurocircuits and to identify druggable targets for treating metabolic disorders. The generation of HypoMap To develop a unified hypothalamic cell atlas comprising cell types from major hypothalamic regions, we combined 17 publicly available droplet-based hypothalamus sc-seq datasets5,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41 covering different hypothalamic regions, from the preoptic area POA to the ventroposterior hypothalamus VPH Supplementary Table 1. HypoMap, a harmonized transcriptomic reference map of the murine hypothalamus, faithfully integrates 18 single-cell sequencing experiments that cover almost all hypothalamic regions.\nDataset: Cell

We performed single-cell transcriptome, surface proteome and T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor analyses of over 780,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a cross-sectional cohort of 130 patients with varying severities of COVID-19. We identified expansion of nonclassical monocytes expressing complement transcripts CD16C1QABC that sequester platelets and were predicted to replenish the alveolar macrophage pool in COVID-19. Early, uncommitted CD34 hematopoietic stemprogenitor cells were primed toward megakaryopoiesis, accompanied by expanded megakaryocyte-committed progenitors and increased platelet activation. Clonally expanded CD8 T cells and an increased ratio of CD8 effector T cells to effector memory T cells characterized severe disease, while circulating follicular helper T cells accompanied mild disease. We observed a relative loss of IgA2 in symptomatic disease despite an overall expansion of plasmablasts and plasma cells. Our study highlights the coordinated immune response that contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis and reveals discrete cellular components that can be targeted for therapy. Altered cellular profiles across COVID-19 severities We generated single-cell combined transcriptome and surface proteome data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs from individuals with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critical16 COVID-19 across three UK centers in Newcastle, Cambridge and London, Extended Data and Supplementary Table 1. Our cross-sectional multi-omics PBMC survey revealed several new insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis.\nDataset: Cell Type: mucosal invariant T cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: respiratory system

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

To identify and characterize selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex and the superior frontal gyrusbrain regions where neurofibrillary inclusions and neuronal loss occur early and late in AD, respectivelyfrom postmortem brains spanning the progression of AD-type tau neurofibrillary pathology. We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods. We also discovered an astrocyte subpopulation, likely representing reactive astrocytes, characterized by decreased expression of genes involved in homeostatic functions. Our characterization of selectively vulnerable neurons in AD paves the way for future mechanistic studies of selective vulnerability and potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing neuronal resilience. Cohort selection and cross-sample alignment We performed snRNA-seq on cell nuclei extracted from postmortem brain tissue Methods from the EC at the level of the mid-uncus area and from the superior frontal gyrus SFG at the level of the anterior commissure Brodmann area 8, from ten male individuals carrying the apolipoprotein E gene APOE \u03b53\u03b53 genotype representing the cortical-free, early and late stages of AD-type tau neurofibrillary pathology Braak stages1 0, 2 and 6; and Table 1. Selective vulnerability is a fundamental feature of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic neuron, Tissue: entorhinal cortex, Gene Expression: MALAT1

To identify and characterize selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex and the superior frontal gyrusbrain regions where neurofibrillary inclusions and neuronal loss occur early and late in AD, respectivelyfrom postmortem brains spanning the progression of AD-type tau neurofibrillary pathology. We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods.

To identify and characterize selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex and the superior frontal gyrusbrain regions where neurofibrillary inclusions and neuronal loss occur early and late in AD, respectivelyfrom postmortem brains spanning the progression of AD-type tau neurofibrillary pathology. We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods. We also discovered an astrocyte subpopulation, likely representing reactive astrocytes, characterized by decreased expression of genes involved in homeostatic functions. Our characterization of selectively vulnerable neurons in AD paves the way for future mechanistic studies of selective vulnerability and potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing neuronal resilience.

Here, we investigate the population structure of live microglia purified from human cerebral cortex samples obtained at autopsy and during neurosurgical procedures. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we find that some subsets are enriched for disease-related genes and RNA signatures. We confirm the presence of four of these microglial subpopulations histologically and illustrate the utility of our data by characterizing further microglial cluster 7, enriched for genes depleted in the cortex of individuals with Alzheimers disease AD. Histologically, these cluster 7 microglia are reduced in frequency in AD tissue, and we validate this observation in an independent set of single nucleus data. Thus, our live human microglia identify a range of subtypes, and we prioritize one of these as being altered in AD. Nature and distribution of the single-cell RNA sequencing data The primary goal of this report is to derive a model of microglial population structure with which we can generate and test disease-related hypotheses. details the workflow and the design of this study, which included a discovery dataset of single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq from microglia based on which we define the basic population structure of microglia, in situ confirmation of our findings and independent replication of our observation in two independent datasets, d.: Experimental setup and overview of human samples and datasets used. a Workflow for the generation of the discovery dataset. This manuscript presents a new data set based on 16,096 individual microglial transcriptomes which, using unsupervised clustering, we segregate into 9 clusters of microglia.\nDataset: Cell Type: B

Here, we test whether environmental stress can induce cellular dysfunction through modulating RNA-chromatin interactions. We induce endothelial cell EC dysfunction with high glucose and TNF\u03b1 H  T, that mimic the common stress in diabetes mellitus. We characterize the H  T-induced changes in gene expression by single cell scRNA-seq, DNA interactions by Hi-C, and RNA-chromatin interactions by iMARGI. H  T induce inter-chromosomal RNA-chromatin interactions, particularly among the super enhancers. To test the causal relationship between H  T-induced RNA-chromatin interactions and the expression of EC dysfunction-related genes, we suppress the LINC00607 RNA. This suppression attenuates the expression of SERPINE1, a critical pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene. Furthermore, the changes of the co-expression gene network between diabetic and healthy donor-derived ECs corroborate the H  T-induced RNA-chromatin interactions. Taken together, caRNA-mediated dysregulation of gene expression modulates EC dysfunction, a crucial mechanism underlying numerous diseases.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing with capture-based cell identification on autologous axicabtagene ciloleucel axi-cel anti-CD19 CAR T cell infusion products to identify transcriptomic features associated with efficacy and toxicity in 24 patients with LBCL. Patients who achieved a complete response by positron emission tomographycomputed tomography at their 3-month follow-up had three-fold higher frequencies of CD8 T cells expressing memory signatures than patients with partial response or progressive disease. Molecular response measured by cell-free DNA sequencing at day 7 after infusion was significantly associated with clinical response P  0.008, and a signature of CD8 T cell exhaustion was associated q  2.8  10149 with a poor molecular response. Furthermore, a rare cell population with monocyte-like transcriptional features was associated P  0.0002 with high-grade ICANS. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in the cellular and molecular features of CAR T cell infusion products contributes to variation in efficacy and toxicity after axi-cel therapy in LBCL, and that day 7 molecular response might serve as an early predictor of CAR T cell efficacy. Gene expression signatures of CAR T cell infusion products determined by scRNA-seq and CapID An overview of our approach is shown in. Our results suggest that cellular and molecular diversity of infused CAR T cell products is a major factor contributing to the variability in efficacy and toxicity among patients with LBCL treated with CD19 CAR T cell therapy.\nDataset: Cell Type: CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell, Tissue: blood, Gene Expression: ACTB TMSB10 TMSB4X B2M GAPDH EEF1A1 RPLP1 MT-CO3 RPL10 PTMA MT-CO1 IL32 RPL13 ACTG1

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

Single-cell RNA sequencing can generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and difficulties in experimental design. Results This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen, esophagus, and lung from  5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison of cell types. We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads, and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples in the spleen, which is cell type specific. Conclusions In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to 24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases the time frames for sample processing. Good scRNA-seq data quality after cold storage We obtained the lung, esophagus, and spleen samples from 12 organ donors Additional file 2: Table S1. We present a method for cold storage of primary human tissue samples that requires no processing at the clinical site beyond sample collection and permits at least a 24-h window for shipping, tissue dissociation, and scRNA-seq.\nDataset: Cell Type: mast cell, Tissue: lung parenchyma, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TPSAB1 TPSB2 FTH1 MT-CO1 TMSB4X MT-ND4 MT-CO2 RPL34 FTL RPLP1 RPL13 MT-ND2 RPS18 RPS14

Single-cell RNA sequencing can generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and difficulties in experimental design. Results This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen, esophagus, and lung from  5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison of cell types. We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads, and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples in the spleen, which is cell type specific. Conclusions In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to 24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases the time frames for sample processing. Good scRNA-seq data quality after cold storage We obtained the lung, esophagus, and spleen samples from 12 organ donors Additional file 2: Table S1. We present a method for cold storage of primary human tissue samples that requires no processing at the clinical site beyond sample collection and permits at least a 24-h window for shipping, tissue dissociation, and scRNA-seq.\nDataset: Cell Type: CD8-alpha alpha positive, gamma-delta intraepithelial T cell, Tissue: spleen, Gene Expression: MALAT1 B2M TMSB4X RPS27 RPL13 RPLP2 RPLP1 RPL13A RPS18

To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of 85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90 of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing. Cell classes in human retina To generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human retina, we obtained eight retinas from seven genetically unrelated human donors with no clinical history of ocular disease Table S1. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq to generate a cell atlas of the adult human retina.\nDataset: Cell Type: retina horizontal cell, Tissue: fovea centralis, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-ND4 GAPDH MT-ATP6 MT-CYB PVALB CKB MT-CO2 MT-ND2 MT-ND1 MT-ND3 SEPTIN4 PKM PCP4 FTH1 SEPTIN7 HSP90AA1 PTMA RPL21 TPI1 ALDOA UBC RPL3 RPL13A HSP90AB1 FTL CALM2 VAMP2 EIF1 PEBP1 RPLP1 HSPA1A RPL34 NEAT1 EIF4A2 RPL10 RPL15 SOD1 RPS15 EEF1A1 HSPB1 HSPA8 CNTNAP2 RPS27A TUBA1B VDAC1 RPL41 YWHAQ ENO1 LDHA MT-ND5 STMN1 RPS14 RPL13 RPL7 CIRBP RPL32 RPL27A RPS18 SKP1 COX4I1 UBB RPS19 PGK1 TAGLN3 RPS3A TERF2IP H3-3B ATP6V1F HSPA1B CHCHD2 RPL11 ITM2B ALDOC RPS28 RPS27 RPL26 RPLP2 RPS23 RPS12 FAU RPL37A RPS2 RPL23A RPS25 PTN SRP14 ANK2 GABARAPL2 PCSK1N MGARP RPL35A RPL9 CFL1 RPS3 EEF2 COX6C RPL18A\nCell Type: retina horizontal cell, Tissue: peripheral region of retina, Gene Expression: MALAT1 GAPDH MT-CO1 MT-ND4 MT-CO3 HSP90AA1 CKB MT-ATP6 PVALB PKM ENO1 ALDOA MT-CYB TPI1 MT-CO2 MT-ND2 PTMA FTH1 MT-ND1 UBC HSPA1A LDHA HSP90AB1 SEPTIN7 VAMP2 PGK1 MT-ND3 HSPA8 NEAT1 VDAC1 ALDOC SYNPR EIF1 MGARP PEBP1 HSPB1 EEF1A1 BNIP3 RPL21 EIF4A2 RPL13A ACTB FTL CALM2 RPL3 CNTNAP2 CALB1 H3-3B ITM2B RPLP1 RPL15 TERF2IP BTG1 RPS15 RORB UBB PSAP RTN4 CHCHD2 SEPTIN4 RPL41 NDFIP1 ATP1B1 PGAM1 OAZ1 SOD1 GPX3 RPL10 SKP1 RPL34 YWHAQ RPS28 PCSK1N SEC62 RPL13 RPS27A GABARAPL2 ENO2 RPL7 CALM1 CIRBP NDRG4 MORF4L1 MT-ND5 ACTG1 PTN RPS3A CDC42EP4 TAGLN3 RPS14 CFL1 CACNG3 RPL32 RPS27 HNRNPA2B1 RPL37A ZNF593OS RPLP2 LNP1 SPP1\n"}]}}

Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90 of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing. Cell classes in human retina To generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human retina, we obtained eight retinas from seven genetically unrelated human donors with no clinical history of ocular disease Table S1. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq to generate a cell atlas of the adult human retina.\nDataset: Cell Type: retinal cone cell, Tissue: fovea centralis, Gene Expression: MALAT1 PDE6H GAPDH CKB RCVRN GUK1 MT-ND4 PKM MT-CO3 ARR3 MT-CO1 GUCA1A MT-CYB MT-ATP6 EEF1A1 PCP4 ENO2 HSP90AA1 GNB3 MT-CO2 UNC119 RTBDN MAP1B ALDOC TPI1 NDUFA4 LDHA RPL3 RPL34 MT-ND2 RPLP1 ALDOA RPL13A VAMP2 PDC GUCA1C YBX1 PTMA OPN1LW KCNV2 RPL21 UQCRH MT-ND3 FTH1 PRDX1 MYL6 HMGN1 COX7A2 RPL10 TUBA1B AIPL1 RPS15 RPLP0 SYT1 PPA1 RPL13 UQCRB COX7C COX6A1 MT-ND1 RPL15 PLEKHB1 RPS7 CHCHD10 RPL32 COX6C RPS14 SEC62 TUBB4B UBC ACTG1 RPS6 AKAP9 RPS18 RPL7 NME1 COX5B RPS27A SRP14 RPS23 RPS25 RPL8 PGAM1 APLP2 SNAP25 RTN4 H3-3B COX4I1 PGK1 RPL41 TMA7 FAU RPL27A RPS3 PRDX2 PRCD RPL11 FTL LBH CPLX4\nCell Type: retinal cone cell, Tissue: peripheral region of retina, Gene Expression: PDE6H MALAT1 EEF1A1 RCVRN GAPDH MT-ND4 CKB GUK1 FTH1 YBX1 RPL13A MT-CO1 MT-CO3 RPLP1 GUCA1A RPL21 RPL34 RPL3 MT-ATP6 UQCRB NDUFA4 GUCA1C MT-ND3 RPL41 RPL13 MT-CYB RPL7 ARR3 RPL10 RPS15 RPL32 MT-CO2 RPS27 RPS6 UQCRH RPS28 PTMA MT-ND1 RPL15 FTL RPS3A MT-ND2 RPL18A UNC119 RPL37A RPS3 RPS25 RPL26 RPL11 RPS16 PLEKHB1 RPS7 PKM RPS20 RPS14 RPS27A MYL6 PDC RPL8 RPL6 NME1 RPL27A RPL39 RPS19 RPS13 COX7C RPS15A RPL28 RPS12 RPL35A TPT1 RPL9 RPL31 RPS29 FAU ENO2 TPI1 HSP90AA1 RPS18 PPA1 COX6A1 RPS24 RPLP0 RPL14 RPL36 LDHA AIPL1 RPS23 RPL35 RPL12 RPS4X UQCR10 RPS8 VAMP2 GNB3 RPS5 ALDOA RPS2 RACK1 NDUFA1\nCell Type: retinal rod cell, Tissue: fovea centralis, Gene Expression: MALAT1 FTH1 RHO MT-ND4 MT-CO3 PDE6G RCVRN MT-ATP6 SAG ROM1 GAPDH CKB MT-CO1 HSP90AA1 MT-CYB NRL GNGT1 MT-CO2 GNAT1 AIPL1 EEF1A1 RPL3 UNC119 RPL21 PKM RPL10 RPLP1 MT-ND3 RPL13 MT-ND1 HMGN1 GUCA1A MT-ND2 PDE6A RPS27A ENO2 RPL13A RPL34 RPS15 PTMA RPL32 RPS18 RPS9 RPL11 RPS14 RPS6 RPS7 LDHA GNB1 CNGA1 NDUFA4 UBC YBX1 RPL8 RTBDN H3-3B RPL41 TPI1 TUBA1B RPL15 PDC VAMP2 ALDOC FTL RPS23 RPS3A RPL18A RPS25 RPL27A RPL26 RPL9 RPS13 RPS12 EIF1 RPS8 MYL6 MAP1B RPS27 CPE RPS3 RPLP0 RP1 RPL35 RPS19 RPS28 RPS16 FAU RPL37A RPS15A CALM2 UQCRB TUBB4B RPS4X RPL35A RPL6 PRCD RPL7 RPL28 RBP3 GNB3\nCell Type: retinal rod cell, Tissue: peripheral region of retina, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ND4 RCVRN MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 MT-CYB HSP90AA1 FTH1 GAPDH CKB EEF1A1 MT-CO2 MT-ND3 MT-ND2 MT-ND1 PKM UNC119 GUCA1A ROM1 RPL21 ENO2 RPL13A YBX1 PTMA RPL3 RHO AIPL1 LDHA RPL41 MAP1B HSPA1A GUK1 RPLP1 RPL11 PDE6H PDE6G RPL34 RPL10 MT-ND5 GNGT1 RPS6 PLEKHB1 H3-3B CPE RPL13 RPS27 VAMP2 KCNV2 GNB3 RTBDN RPS28 PDC SAG RPL32 RPS27A RPL15 TPI1 RPS15 HMGN1 EIF1 FTL NRL UBC RPS7 RPL8 GNAT1 UQCRB RPL7 NDUFA4 RPL18A RPS25 RPS3 RTN4 RPL37A RPS14 ALDOC RPS13 ALDOA RPS12 RBP3 RPS16 GPX3 HSPA1B RPL6 RPS18 MYL6 SYT1 RPL9 RPL26 RPS3A RPL28 ACTG1 RPL27A SNAP25 UBB COX7C RPS8 RPL35A PGAM1\n"}]}}

To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of 85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90 of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing. Cell classes in human retina To generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human retina, we obtained eight retinas from seven genetically unrelated human donors with no clinical history of ocular disease Table S1. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq to generate a cell atlas of the adult human retina.\nDataset: Cell Type: OFF-bipolar cell, Tissue: fovea centralis, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ND4 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-ATP6 MT-CYB GAPDH CKB MT-CO2 H3-3B RPL3 MT-ND2 RPL21 MT-ND1 VAMP2 EEF1A1 RPL13A MT-ND3 FTH1 RPL13 CALM2 RPL34 PKM SYT1 RPL15 RPS15 HSP90AA1 RPLP1 NDUFA4 STMN1 TPI1 RPL10 RPS27A EIF1 RPS14 FTL CCNI RPL41 ALDOA RPS3A RPL7 LDHA RPL32 RPS18 RPS27 SNAP25 CPE RPS12 PTMA RPL27A RPS3 RPL11 RPL8 RPS25 MT-ND5 RPS19 BTG1 RPL26 RPL37A TUBA1B RPS8 ITM2B PEBP1 RPS6 CIRBP RTN4 HSP90AB1 EIF4A2 RPL9 APLP2 RPS7 UBC RPS13 RPL35A RPS23 RPS28 RPS4X FAU UNC119 PGAM1 RPL23A RPS9 RPL35 ACTG1 PCP4 MEG3 VDAC1 RPS24 CAMK2B COX7A2 COX4I1 RPS2 PRDX2 RPL18A TERF2IP ENO2 SRP14 UQCRB RPL6 SOD1\nCell Type: OFF-bipolar cell, Tissue: peripheral region of retina, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ND4 GAPDH MT-CO1 MT-ATP6 MT-CO3 MT-CYB CKB EEF1A1 RPL3 MT-ND1 HSP90AA1 PKM VAMP2 LDHA RPL21 RPL13A H3-3B MT-ND2 TPI1 ALDOA MT-CO2 MT-ND3 FTH1 RPL13 RPL15 CCNI RPS15 HSPA1A RPL34 SYT1 PTMA FTL RPL10 RPL41 PGAM1 RPS27 RPLP1 RPS3A RPS27A EIF1 PGK1 RPL7 UBC RPL37A MT-ND5 RPL32 ENO1 STMN1 RPS14 HSPB1 RPS3 RPL27A PCP4 RPL11 HSP90AB1 RPS12 CPE SNAP25 RPS6 NDUFA4 ALDOC RPS25 RPS18 RPS28 RPL26 ITM2B ACTG1 RPL9 RPL8 UQCRB RPL23A RPS13 RPS19 BTG1 ENO2 RTN4 RPL35A CALM2 EIF4A2 RPS24 RPS8 PEBP1 RPS7 RPL6 UNC119 RPL36 RPS4X RPL5 RPLP2 FAU UBB TPT1 CADPS BNIP3 OAZ1 HSPA8 HSPA1B RPS16 RPL24\nCell Type: ON-bipolar cell, Tissue: fovea centralis, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ND4 MT-CO3 MT-CYB MT-ATP6 MT-CO1 GAPDH MT-ND2 CKB MT-CO2 MT-ND1 MT-ND3 VAMP2 H3-3B RPL3 CALM2 RPL21 EEF1A1 RPL13A FTH1 EIF1 RPL13 SYT1 HSP90AA1 RPL34 RPL15 RPS15 NDUFA4 RPL10 SNAP25 RPLP1 TMSB4X RPS14 RPL41 UBB CALM1 MT-ND5 ITM2B RPS27A PKM ALDOA RPS6 RTN4 TPI1 FTL RPS3A CPE PEBP1 GNG13 VDAC1 RPS27 RPL7 RPS3 RPS18 RPS12 RPL32 RPL8 RPL27A RPS25 STMN1 RPL9 RPL11 SRP14 PTMA CIRBP COX4I1 RPL37A CAMK2B EIF4A2 COX7A2 GNB3 RPS19 TERF2IP SOD1 RPL35A RPS28 FAU HSP90AB1 OAZ1 UBC UNC119 UQCRB RPS13 APLP2 PRDX2 SKP1 RPS7 RPS8 HSPA8 RPS24 SPCS1 RPL26 ACTG1 CHCHD2 RPS23 LRTM1 TUBA1B COX7C RGS16 HMGB1\nCell Type: ON-bipolar cell, Tissue: peripheral region of retina, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ND4 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 GAPDH MT-ATP6 MT-CYB HSP90AA1 MT-ND1 MT-ND2 MT-ND3 MT-CO2 RPL3 VAMP2 HSPA1A EEF1A1 H3-3B RPL13A RPL21 PCP2 TPI1 LDHA HSPB1 ALDOA FTH1 CALM1 CKB RPL15 SNAP25 RPL41 RPL13 EIF1 RPL34 RPS27 RPS15 PKM CALM2 UBC ITM2B GNG13 PCP4 FTL MT-ND5 RPL10 RPL37A RPS3A RPS14 RPLP1 PTMA RPL7 UBB PGAM1 HSP90AB1 RPS3 VDAC1 RPS6 RPL32 UQCRB RPS27A RPL11 RPL27A RPL9 APLP2 NDUFA4 RPS28 TMSB4X RPL35A RPS25 CPE HSPA8 CPLX3 GPX3 RTN4 RPL8 SYT1 RPS18 RPS24 RPS29 RPL26 OAZ1 RPS13 RPL36 COX4I1 RPS12 SOD1 SRP14 RPS7 PEBP1 BTG1 RPS19 EIF4A2 COX7C RPL6 RPS8 PGK1 FAU RPL23A ENO1 RPL31 ACTG1\n"}]}}

Emerging computational methods applied to high-dimensional single-cell data allow integration of results between samples and species and illuminate the diversity and underlying developmental and architectural organization of cell populations. Here, we illustrate these methods in the analysis of mouse lymph node LN lymphatic endothelial cells LEC at single-cell resolution. Clustering identifies five well-delineated subsets, including two medullary sinus subsets not previously recognized as distinct. Nearest neighbor alignments in trajectory space position the major subsets in a sequence that recapitulates the known features and suggests novel features of LN lymphatic organization, providing a transcriptional map of the lymphatic endothelial niches and of the transitions between them. Differences in gene expression reveal specialized programs for 1 subcapsular ceiling endothelial interactions with the capsule connective tissue and cells; 2 subcapsular floor regulation of lymph borne cell entry into the LN parenchyma and antigen presentation; and 3 pathogen interactions and 4 LN remodeling in distinct medullary subsets. LEC of the subcapsular sinus floor and medulla, which represent major sites of cell entry and exit from the LN parenchyma respectively, respond robustly to oxazolone inflammation challenge with enriched signaling pathways that converge on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Integration of mouse and human single-cell profiles reveals a conserved cross-species pattern of lymphatic vascular niches and gene expression, as well as specialized human subsets and genes unique to each species. The examples provided demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis in elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, vascular organization, and endothelial cell responses. We discuss the findings from the perspective of LEC functions in relation to niche formations in the unique stromal and highly immunological environment of the LN.

Introduction Lymph nodes LNs serve as hubs for the interaction and communication between tissue-derived and blood-derived immune cells 1. Integrated along the large collecting lymphatic vessels, they are vital sensors of tissue damage, constantly sampling the incoming lymph 2. The LN comprises a complex network of lymphatic sinuses surrounding a dense parenchyma, which mainly consists of immune cells but also specialized blood vessels and a network of mesenchymal cells 13. Segregated B cell cortex and T cell paracortex areas characterize the LN architecture 4. It is well-established that the LN stromal cells play a central role in maintaining both this structure and the immunological functions of the LN, providing chemotactic cues, cytokines, and a structural reticular framework that guide immune cell positioning, migration, survival, and activation reviews: 3, 5. Single-cell sequencing has enabled delineation of nine distinct clusters of murine LN mesenchymal cell phenotypes 6 underlining the complexity needed to maintain the LN structure and coordinate immunity. The lymphatic vasculature is the first structural component of the LN encountered by incoming lymph-borne molecules or cells. Recent studies have revealed an intriguing regional specialization and cellular heterogeneity that characterize the LN lymphatic endothelium and differentiate the LN lymphatic endothelial cells LECs from LECs in peripheral lymphatic vessels 712. Subset-specific markers with functional implications include the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR4 also known as CCRL1, specifically expressed by the LEC layer that forms the ceiling cLECs of the subcapsular sinus SCS 9, where lymph enters from the afferent collecting vessels. ACKR4 is a scavenger receptor for the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 13 and controls entry of tissue-derived dendritic cells DCs into the LN through controlling the formation of CCL21 chemokine gradients across the SCS 9. Leukocyte entry occurs primarily through the SCS floor LECs fLECs, which in mouse express the mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 MAdCAM-1 7, 14 among other adhesion and attractant molecules that can control leukocyte transmigration 7, 15. The SCS also functions as a physical barrier and gateway, enabling size-restricted access of antigens to the LN parenchyma 16: the glycoprotein plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein PLVAP, together with cLEC-expressed caveolin 1 CAV1 10, form sieve-like diaphragms in the transendothelial channels that bridge the SCS to the conduit system and descend from the SCS floor 10. This structural barrier is complemented by a dense network of macrophages closely associated with SCS, providing essential innate immune functions and a filtering system for pathogens 17. The SCS and medullary sinus macrophage niches in the LN were recently shown to be dependent on LEC-expressed CSF-1 colony stimulating factor 1 18 and receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03ba B RANKRANKL signaling between the LN LECs and SCS lining mesenchymal cells 19. LN LECs can also directly influence adaptive immune responses, either through presentation of tissue antigens, which contributes to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance 2022, or by serving as reservoirs for antigens 23. LN LECs express the immune-checkpoint ligand programmed death-ligand 1 PD-L1 also known as CD274 7, 24, an inhibitor of T cell activation, and lack expression of co-stimulatory genes 24, which may explain their role in tolerance. PD-L1 is expressed selectively in the floor of the SCS fLECs, cortical sinuses, and parts of the medulla 7, 24. Genes that influence the communication between LECs and their surroundings could contribute to endothelial regulation as well, and interestingly, PD-L1 expression moderates proliferation and enhances survival of LN LECs in inflammation 25. The diverse and site-specific specialization of the LN lymphatic endothelium is at least partly dependent on crosstalk with immune cells, with contributions from B cells, T cells 7, 26, and mesenchymal stromal cells 19. Hence, the LNs provide both a unique model system to explore endothelial cell interactions with their surroundings and a model for exploring endothelial diversity and phenotypic plasticity. Our recent single-cell analysis of the human LN LECs revealed the complexity and specialization of the LN lymphatic endothelium in man 27. A detailed profiling of the mouse lymphatic endothelium and comparison of human and mouse LN lymphatic endothelium is still missing. Here we provide single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the mouse LN lymphatic vasculature. We show that computational alignments relationships revealed by nearest neighbor trajectory inference recapitulate key aspects of the tissue architecture and predict physical relationships between LN LECs in the tissue, illustrating the power of single-cell analysis for understanding the organization of the vascular endothelium. Cross-species analyses further allowed us to define conserved and divergent LEC phenotypes and lymphatic vascular niches. Notably, the analysis delineates two specialized subsets of medullary sinus LECs, present in both mouse and human that are distinct in gene expression and location in the LN. Using the mouse LN response to cutaneous oxazolone as a model, we show that sites of immune cell entry and exit from the LN, fLECs, and paracortical sinuses, respectively, respond rapidly to inflammation, whereas structurally important cLECs are less affected. Together, the results demonstrate the power of bioinformatic tools for elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, physical relationships, and cellular responses in complex vascular beds, and provide a basis for future detailed analysis of human and mouse LN LEC responses in disease. Results and Discussion Single-Cell Trajectories Model Tissue Architecture and Physical Relationships Between LN LECs To assess the heterogeneity of the lymphatic vasculature and the relationships between lymphatic vascular niches, we analyzed lin podoplanin PDPN CD31 cells from mouse peripheral LNs i.e., axillary, brachial and inguinal by single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics system. An independent set of LN LECs was sorted as single cells and subjected to SMART-seq2 analysis 28. Prospero homeobox protein 1 Prox1 was used as a pan-LEC marker in the analysis 29. Blood endothelial cells Flt1Ly6c1, immune cells Cd45, and pericytes Pdgfra or Pdgfrb were identified by marker gene expression and excluded from further analysis. We used a combination of unsupervised clustering and graph-based methods to determine LEC subsets; Methods.. Mouse LN LEC subsets revealed by 10x and SMART-seq2. A Experimental workflow. Mouse peripheral LNs were isolated and dissociated into single-cell suspensions. Hematopoietic cells were MACS-depleted, and EC linCD31 were FACS-sorted for single-cell sequencing using the droplet-based 10x Genomics system or the SMART-seq2 workflow figure created with BioRender.com. B tSNE plots of 4252 LECs processed by 10x left and 383 LECs by SMART-seq2 right. Cells are colored by subset. Numbers indicate the continuum of the lymphatic endothelium. C tSpace analysis of single-cell trajectories depicting nearest neighbor alignments of LECs. D Expression of LEC subset defining genes in C57BL6 mouse 10x. Dots indicate mean log-normalized transcript count. In addition to gene profile-based dimensionality reduction with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding tSNE and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP see below, we used a trajectory analysis algorithm, tSpace 30, to define high dimensional nearest neighbor alignments that emphasize the continuum of cell phenotypes and reveal transitions between related cells. In developing cell systems, trajectory inference methods can model developmental sequence pseudotime 30. In the resting adult vascular endothelium, they facilitate computational modeling of vessel architecture 27, 31. Subsets and alignments were shared in mice with different genetic backgrounds C57BL6 and BALBc Figure S1A. Cells from both male and female mice were represented in the dataset and comprised similar phenotypes Figure S1B. However, the study was not designed or powered to examine strain- or sex-dependent differences in LN LECs, and these remain to be further explored. Our analyses identified major clusters representing LN cLECs and fLECs based on the expression of known SCS ceiling marker Ackr4 9 as well as SCS floor markers Madcam1 7, 14 and the chemokine Ccl20 15, 27 and Figure S1C. Candidate valve-related LECs display high expression of known lymphatic valve markers, including the transcription factor Forkhead box protein C2 Foxc2 32 and Figure S1C. A minor cluster, most apparent in tSpace projections and associated with valve, expressed higher levels of peripheral lymphatic vessels markers including lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 Lyve1 and the chemokine Ccl21, together with lower expression of Foxc2 compared to the candidate valve LECs. This population likely represents collector or pre-collector LECs 2, 32. These subsets were poorly represented in our data and we discuss them in the context of the architecture of LN LECs, but exclude them from detailed differential gene expression analyses below. Unsupervised clusters separate Lyve1 high candidate medullary sinus LEC into two subsets, referred to here as Ptx3-LECs Ptx3 and Marco-LECs Marco and Figure S1C. Alignment of LECs in tSpace visualization recapitulates known connections within the complex lymphatic endothelial network in LN and reveals previously unappreciated relationships as well as intermediate, putative transitional phenotypes. In addition to the subsets identified by clustering, we highlight two transitional populations here, for discussion below. Transition zone tzLECs comprise a link between fLECs and Marco-LECs in tSpace. Additionally, a minor bridge population B aligns along a direct path between fLECs and cLECs in tSpace projection. As emphasized by numbering of subsets in and illustrated schematically in, trajectories starting from candidate collecting LECs 1 lead prominently to valve 2 and to SCS ceiling LEC 3, consistent with their known physical connections. cLECs branch to fLECs through the bridging population B but also transition prominently to Ptx3-LECs 4, Ptx3-LECs to Marco-LECs 5, and Marco-LECs via tzLECs 6 to fLEC 7 along a phenotypic sequence or path that is well-represented in all LEC datasets here. In situ Localization of LN LEC Subsets To define LEC subsets and their niches in situ, we carried out immunofluorescence staining using antibodies to subset differentiating markers predicted from gene expression in inguinal LNs of Prox1-GFP reporter mice 33, where all LECs express the fluorescent reporter GFP. scRNA-seq predicts that LYVE-1 is absent in cLECs and low in fLECs, but is highly expressed in Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs. Staining for LYVE-1 highlights the cortical, paracortical, and entire medullary region of mouse inguinal LN Figures 2A,B. Expression of Cd274, which encodes the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1, distinguishes fLECs, Marco-LECs, and tzLECs Cd274high from Ptx3-LECs Cd274low and Figure S1C. Co-immunostaining of PD-L1 and LYVE-1 shows that PD-L1 expression defines the fLECs and discrete regions of LYVE-1high medullary sinus LECs that are distant from the hilus. Expression of Marco, which encodes the scavenger receptor Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure MARCO, is highly selective for Marco-LECs: MARCO is a known medullary sinus marker in human LN 27, 34. We show that MARCO expression pattern in the mouse LN medulla selectively overlaps with that of PD-L1. Conversely, in situ hybridization for Ptx3 RNAscope specifically outlines the central medullary sinuses with particularly strong signals in the paracortical cords Figures 3A,B, overlapping with the area of LYVE-1high PD-L1 MARCO cords outlined by protein staining. Co-staining of MARCO and the B-cell marker B220 shows that MARCOhigh regions start from the cortical areas defined based on presence of B-cell follicles and extend into the peri-follicular medulla of both inguinal and popliteal LNs Figure S2. The PD-L1, MARCO sinuses Ptx3-LECs are instead associated with a network of scattered B lineage cells Figure S2, a typical feature of the medullary region in the LN, where the lymphatic cords are surrounded by plasma cells 4, 35. Trajectory analysis predicts that Ptx3-LECs are contiguous with the SCS ceiling, which is also evident along the efferent side of the LN where the LYVE-1 outermost endothelial layers cLECs connect to the LYVE-1 cords i.e., Ptx3-LECs Figure S3..

As noted above, trajectory analysis predicts a close relationship between Marco-LECs and fLECs, and identifies a transitional population tzLECs between them. tzLECs are characterized by variable and often intermediate expression of fLEC e.g., Madcam1 and Ccl20 and Marco-LEC associated genes e.g. Marco and Lyve1. Histologic analysis identifies a region of LECs between fLECs and Marco-LECs that displays expression patterns consistent with this transitional phenotype. Cells of this phenotype can be observed between the fLECs and Marco-LECs in the region between the bilateral lobes of the inguinal LN and at the LN margins, where the lining cells display reduced MAdCAM-1 compared to the majority of fLEC and increasing levels of LYVE-1. Few if any genes are specific to tzLECs i.e., not shared with fLECs or Marco-LECs, and unbiased non-negative matrix factorization does not identify a gene set specific to the subset data not shown. Thus, the tzLECs highlighted here are part of a continuum between fLEC and Marco-LEC populations, defining an area of vascular zonation. Consistent with computational predictions, the results favor a model in which Marco-LECs occupy the perifollicular medulla in association to the LN cortex, with the transitional phenotype tzLECs bridging them to the SCS floor..

B Heatmap of selected DEGs in the C57BL6 mouse 10x LN LEC subsets. Values are imputed log counts row scaled. Hence, we have demonstrated the organization of LEC in situ, with SCS ceiling converging on Ptx3-LECs, Ptx3-LECs to Marco-LECs and tzLECs, then leading to fLECs Figures 24, which mirrors the phenotypic progression revealed by trajectory analysis. A schematic of the LN LEC connections is shown in. LEC Molecular Phenotypes Correspond With Their Vascular Niches and Functions The cLEC Molecular Profile Reflects Interaction With the LN Capsule cLECs connect to afferent and efferent collecting vessels, and co-express several genes with valve-related LECs, including higher levels of Foxc2 36 compared to other LN subsets and Figure S1C. Deletion of Foxc2 in lymphatic vessels has been shown to lead to downregulation of the cLEC marker Ackr4, but also to mislocation of surrounding smooth muscle cells 36. cLECs interact physically with the relatively rigid capsule that surrounds LNs. The capsule is a dense network of connective tissue and hence is a unique extracellular matrix ECM, distinct from other parts of the LN 4. Reflecting this, cLECs are highly enriched for genes encoding ECM proteins, Multimerin protein 1 and 2 Mmrn1 and Mmrn2, together with high levels of Platelet-derived growth factor a and b Pdgfa and Pdgfb, Jagged-1 Jag1 a ligand for Notch receptors on both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and Endothelin 1 Edn1 a vasoactive peptide and known lymphatic constrictor, proteins known to maintain interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells 37, 38 and Figure S4. The capsule was recently shown to have a CD34 stromal cell subset with expression of CD248 6, a ligand for MMRN2. MMRN2 can also interact with cLEC expressed MMRN2-ligand Cd93, which was recently coupled to ECM fibrillogenesis in tumor blood endothelium 39. cLECs express the BMP family members Growth differentiation factor 10 Gdf10 and the Bone morphogenic protein 4 Bmp4, which differentiate cLECs from fLECs as well as bridging cells in the SCS and Figures S4, S5. fLEC instead express Bmp2 and Figures S4, S5. The expression of BMPs may mediate both autocrine and paracrine signaling to the surrounding stromal and immune cells. fLECs: An Immune-Active Subset fLECs are the gatekeeper for lymph-derived immune cell entry into the lymph node parenchyma. In keeping with this role, fLECs are characterized by genes involved in immune cell adhesion including Madcam1, Icam1, Vcam1, and Glycam1, supporting active immune cell migration Figures 1D, 5B and Figure S4. These adhesion receptors may also help retain the closely associated SCS macrophages 17. fLECs are also enriched for chemokines, including the known fLEC marker Ccl20 CCR6 ligand 15, 27 but also Cxcl1 CXCR2 ligand Figures 1D, 5B and Figure S4. CCL20 has been linked to innate lymphoid cell ILC trafficking across the SCS 15 and may affect the cross-talk between CCR6-positive DCs and LECs in antigen presentation 40. CCL20 could also influence B cell homeostasis, as memory B cell precursors are distinguished by high CCR6 expression in lymphoid organs of both mouse and man 41 and are closely associated to the SCS 42. CXCL1 may instead contribute to neutrophil migration and recruitment 43. fLECs and Marco-LECs, both macrophage-rich niches 17, share high expression of Csf1 and Figure S4, and fLECs express Platelet factor 4 Pf4 also known as CXCL4 and Figure S4. CSF-1 and CXCL4 both regulate monocyte and macrophage functions 18, 44 and LEC-derived CSF-1 is required to maintain the LN macrophage niches 18. As mentioned earlier, Bmp2 is specifically expressed by fLECs and Figures S4, S5 that are also enriched for both Smad1 and Smad4 and Figure S4 suggesting a role for BMP-signaling in fLEC homeostasis. Another distinguishing feature of fLECs is their expression of CD74 and Figure S4, the MHC class II-associated invariant chain. CD74 is involved in the formation and transport of MHC class II-antigen complexes 45. Together with high levels of H2-Ab1 and Figure S4, this supports a major role of this subset in LN LEC-mediated antigen presentation. Together with the high expression of PD-L1 Cd274 in fLECs Figures 2, 5B and Figure S4, and given that antigens are continuously transported from afferent lymphatics into the SCS, this places the fLECs as the major niche for LN LEC-mediated tolerance. In contrast to all other subsets, fLECs and tzLECs lacks detectable expression of the scavenger receptor Stabilin 2 Stab2, a sinusoidal endothelial marker 46, and have low expression of the tight junction protein Claudin 5 Cldn5 and Figures S4, S6. The latter suggests that junctional properties of the fLECs differ compared to other LN LECs and may reflect requirements for the active immune migration at this site. Marco-LECs: MARCO Medullary Sinus LECs Immunofluorescence staining for MARCO in mouse inguinal LN shows that it delineates the medullary sinuses adjacent to the B cell follicles in the LN cortex perifollicular sinuses. MARCO expression coincides with PD-L1 expression in the medullary sinuses, and is excluded from the PD-L1 negative medullary sinuses closest to the hilus and Figure S2. Lymph from SCS passes through this lymphatic meshwork, abundant in macrophages that can capture lymph-borne pathogens 17, 47. While MARCO is also marker for medullary macrophages 47, a major part of the MARCO expression within the adult LN is however confined to LECs. MARCO expression is also abundant in human LN medullary sinuses 27, 34. In macrophages, MARCO expression facilitates phagocytic clearance by binding both gram-negative and positive bacteria 48, but its function in LECs is not known. Marco-LECs also express the C-type lectin Clec1b CLEC2 and Figure S4, a ligand for podoplanin PDPN. CLEC2 is also expressed by myeloid cells, including DCs 49, and interaction between PDPN fibroblastic reticular cells FRCs and CLEC2 DCs has been implicated in FRC contractility and LN expansion in inflammation 49, 50. LN LEC-expressed CLEC2 may mediate both homotypic and heterotypic cell interactions, since PDPN is highly expressed by LECs and by surrounding FRCs. Stab2 is highly expressed by Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs Figure S6, and together with Ptx3-LECs they are also enriched for the coagulation factor VIII F8 and Figure S4. We previously showed that LN LECs are a major source of FVIII production 51. The present result shows that F8 along with Stab2 are features of medullary LEC subsets. Their co-expression may be a general feature of sinusoidal EC, since both are also characteristic of hepatic sinusoidal endothelium. FVIII forms a complex with von Willebrand factor vWF in plasma, a complex that is cleared by STAB2-expressing liver sinusoidal blood endothelial cells in a vWF-dependent manner 52. However, the very low expression of vWF by mouse LN LECs 51 and data not shown suggests that FVIII may function as a pro-coagulant factor independent of vWF, possibly promoting the formation of fibrin mesh to block the spread of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus in the medulla 53. The results show that Marco-LECs share gene expression patterns with myeloid cells, suggesting that this LEC subpopulation has a major role in innate immune functions. Interestingly, Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs express higher levels of Kdr, encoding VEGFR2, than other LN subsets and Figure S4, which is discussed in further detail below. Ptx3-LECs: Ptx3 Central Medulla and Paracortical Sinus LECs Marco and Pd-l1 Cd274 Ptx3-LECs uniquely express Pentraxin-3 Ptx3 and. They are also distinguished by expression of Inter-\u03b1-trypsin inhibitor 5 Itih5, Mannose receptor C-type 1 Mrc1, Reelin Reln and a relative enrichment in Lyve1 and Stab2 and Figure S4 and Ccl21a, in C57BL6 mice. PTX3 belongs to the pentraxin family: secreted proteins with a cyclic and multimeric structure 54. They bind pathogens and damaged self-proteins, acting as soluble pattern recognition molecules that mediate activation of complement and promote phagocytosis 54. Medullary sinuses also support sustained and close interactions with long-lived plasma cells 35 and thus adaptive antibody-based and innate responses are likely to provide complementary defense mechanisms at this site. Ptx3-LECs share gene expression with dermal capillary LECs, with which they share morphologic features. Both have sprout-like blind ends specialized for attracting leukocytes and fluid flow into the lymphatics 4, 55 Figures 2, 3. Ptx3 itself is not expressed by dermal capillary LEC in mouse, but capillary and Ptx3-LECs share Itih5, Mrc1, Ccl21, and Lyve1 5658 and data not shown. CCL21 mediates recruitment of CCR7 dendritic cells DCs and T cells into dermal lymphatic capillaries 58, 59. Although in the peripheral LN Ptx3-LECs analyzed here Ccl21 expression is relatively low compared with levels in candidate collecting vessels in, it is more highly expressed in Ptx3-LEC in mesenteric LN not shown and in the human LN, as discussed below. Thus, CCL21 in Ptx3-LECs may contribute to leukocyte-LEC interactions and egress of CCR7 cells including na\u00efve B and T cells, possibly complementing the known role of sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P in this process 55, 60. Expression of the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 promotes the transmigration of DCs into blind-ended capillary lymphatic vessels 57. MRC-1, a known marker for subsets of macrophages, binds microorganisms and promotes phagocytosis 48. MRC-1 expression in peripheral lymphatic vessels also facilitates interaction with CD44-expressing immune cells 56, and could thus interact with activated CD44high T cells in egress from the LN. Thus, the paracortical and medullary sinus Ptx3-LECs share with peripheral capillary LECs gene programs for LEC-immune cell interactions, and support lymphocyte entry into medullary sinuses and exit from the LN. Ptx3 itself, as well as other genes selective to Ptx3-LECs, have known or proposed roles in the extracellular matrix ECM 54. PTX3 binds collagen and fibrinogen-domain containing proteins, including ECM components, but also other pattern recognition molecules like C1q and ficolins 61; thus, it may amplify innate pathogen recognition mechanisms and contribute to maintenance and repair of the LN medullary environment. The Ptx3-LEC marker Reelin Reln is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. In the periphery, Reelin is associated with the transition of peripheral capillary vessels to collecting vessels and contributes to the cross-talk between collecting vessel and surrounding smooth-muscle cells 62. ITIH5 was originally isolated in a complex with hyaluronan 63 which can stabilize the ECM 64. Notably, Ptx3-LECs also express high levels of the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 and ITIH-proteins have been shown to interact with PTX3 65. This provides a possible functional link between LYVE-1, ITIH5, and PTX3 in the Ptx3-LEC niche. Ptx3-LECs are also enriched for the collagen and integrin-binding ECM protein TGFbeta-induced protein Tgfbi and Figure S4, which is induced in LECs by hypoxia 66. Together with high levels of the ECM protein Mmrn1 and Figure S4, these genes support the notion of a highly specialized medullary ECM. Ptx3-LECs show the highest levels of Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 Vegfr3, or Flt4 67 and of its co-receptor Neuropilin 2 Nrp2 68 and Figure S4, suggesting a higher responsiveness to vascular endothelial growth factor C VEGFC 69, 70. VEGFC is a major driver of lymphangiogenesis in development 69 and in the adult lymphatic vasculature 71. VEGFR2 Kdr, which binds both VEGFC and VEGFA 67, is also highly expressed in Ptx3-LECs, although it is most enriched in Marco-LECs. Thus, VEGFA and VEGFC may elicit niche-specific responses in medullary sinus LECs, acting differently on Vegfr3high Vegfr2intermed Ptx3-LECs and Vegfr3intermedlow Vegfr2high Marco-LECs. Interestingly, while SCS fLEC and cLECs are established in embryogenesis 36, the medullary sinuses form by sprouting during the first two postnatal weeks 72. Thus, high Vegfr3 Flt4 in Ptx3-LEC could reflect retention of their postnatal programs for VEGFC-dependent sprouting 72, and may imbue them with the capacity to regenerate or expand rapidly in response to the requirements of LN inflammatory responses. It is well-established that it is primarily the LYVE-1 medullary and paracortical sinuses that expand in response to inflammation and in tumor draining LNs 73, 74. The Ptx3-LEC marker Angiopoietin 2 Angpt2 has also been linked to LEC proliferation 75, 76: it can induce lymphatic hyperplasia when overexpressed 76 and is highly expressed by newly formed lymphatic vessels in inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis 75. Ptx3-LECs, like cLECs, but in contrast to all other parenchymal LN LEC subsets, also lack expression of PD-L1 Cd274. Loss of PD-L1 is associated with increased LN LEC proliferation but also increased LEC apoptosis after inflammation 25. Thus, low PD-L1 suggest higher responsiveness not only to proliferation-inducing signals but also higher sensitivity to apoptotic cell death, the latter thought to facilitate LN contraction after inflammatory stimuli 25. Taken together, high Vegfr3, Vegfr2, Nrp2, Angpt2, and low Cd274 PD-L1 suggest a major role of Ptx3-LECs in LN remodeling. A Cellular Bridge Between the SCS Ceiling and Floor As discussed earlier, trajectory analysis not only predicts a transitional population, tzLECs, that link fLEC and Marco-LEC, but further identifies a bridge population that connects cLEC and fLEC. This bridge population is variably represented in the mouse samples and Figure S1A but is prominent in the human see below,. We plotted gene expression of cells along the path from cLEC to fLEC Figure S5 and Figure S7A and found that individual cells within the bridge display variable levels of cLEC and fLEC marker transcripts including Lyve1 Figure S7A, but overall a decreasing gradient of cLEC markers e.g., Ackr4 and Cav1 and an increasing gradient of fLEC markers Madcam1, Pd-l1Cd274 in the progression from cLEC to fLEC Figure S7A. We speculate that these cells participate in formation of previously described transendothelial channels, physical bridges that link the subcapsular ceiling and floor 10, 12, 36. Immunofluorescence imaging indicate that these cords consist not only of channels 10, 36, but also nucleated LECs traversing the sinus, as indicated by nuclear staining for the lymphatic reporter Prox1-GFP Figure S7B. We used immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization for RNA RNAscope to evaluate bridge cell expression of cLEC and fLEC markers Figure S7 and Figure S5. Most bridging cells displayed defining phenotypes of cLEC LYVE-1, PD-L1, MAdCAM-1 or fLEC LYVE-1, PD-L1, MAdCAM-1 on the protein level. Cells co-expressing these cLEC and fLEC markers as predicted for cells of the computationally defined bridge were rare or absent Figure S7. However, RNAscope revealed that bridging cells lack mRNA for Bmp4 cLEC marker and have intermediate expression of Bmp2 fLEC marker, a pattern consistent with the single cell profiles of the predicted bridge Figure S5. Although this observation provides some support for the correspondence between the physical and trajectory-inferred cellular bridges, they are far from being conclusive. An alternative possibility is that fLEC and cLEC can interconvert in response to local environmental signals, and that the transcription profiles of these bridge cells are snapshots of cells in process of these transitions. Further experiments are required to map the computationally defined bridge cells within the LN lymphatic network and to confidently identify the profiles of the in situ cellular links between SCS floor and ceiling. Niche-Specific Inflammatory Responses in LN LECs Oxazolone Oxa is a chemical compound used in a prototypical model for inflammation-induced LN hypertrophy 73. We here chose to look at initial LEC responses 48 h after topical skin application of Oxa, before any major lymphangiogenic responses are expected. Lymphangiogenesis is a late effect in LN remodeling, peaking at 57 days after Oxa, or other inflammatory stimuli 25, 73, 77. We aligned LEC of the Oxa-treated mouse with the untreated control of the same genetic background and observed two new subsets, termed Ox1 and Ox2, in the immunized group.. Niche-specific inflammatory responses in LN LECs. A tUMAP UMAP on trajectory distances of LEC from Oxa-treated and control mice, colored by subsets, including the two additional subsets Ox1 and Ox2 in the Oxa-treated group left. tPC principal components on trajectory distances of LEC from Oxa-treated and control mice, highlighting Ox1 red and Ox2 blue respectively right. B Pairwise Pearson correlation of LEC subsets in Oxa-treated group, calculated using the subset mean expression of the top 1,000 variable genes.

Heatmaps of 50 select upregulated or downregulated DEGs, with ribosomal genes excluded from the downregulated panel lower; row scaled. D Select GO terms and BioPlanet pathways from Enrichr analysis of DEGs. Inspection of the tSpace projections tUMAP UMAP on trajectory distances and tPC principal components of trajectory distances suggests that Ox1 arises from fLECs, and Ox2 from Ptx3-LECs. Pairwise Pearson correlation based on the top 1,000 variable genes confirmed that Ox1 is most correlated with fLECs Pearson correlation coefficient  0.97 and Ox2 with Ptx3-LECs Pearson correlation coefficient  0.92. We asked which genes were differentially expressed in Ox1 and Ox2 due to Oxa treatment. Compared to fLEC and Ptx3-LEC in untreated LN, respectively, we found that both Ox1 and Ox2 displayed typical interferon IFN responses, with dramatic induction of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 as well as Irf7, the master regulator of type-I IFN-dependent immune responses 78. CXCL9 and CXCL10 bind CXCR3, which mediates recruitment of dendritic cells, NK cells, effector T-cells 79 and, in inflamed LNs, subsets of monocytes 80. Both Ox1 and Ox2 also showed upregulated Psme2, a proteosomal component involved in peptide processing for class I antigen presentation 81. While most gene changes were shared, some were preferentially or more dramatically increased in one or the other subset. Ccl20, which is selectively expressed by fLEC in resting LNs, is highly upregulated in Ox1 but not Ox2, maintaining its selective pattern of expression in the SCS floor Figures 1D, 5B, 6C. Ox1 also displays selective upregulation of Ubiquitin D Ubd, important in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B 82. Oxa controls subset-specific upregulation of monocyte chemoattractants Ccl2 Ox2 and Ccl5 Ox1. CCL5 acts through CCR5, which is expressed by multiple adaptive and innate immune subsets; while CCL2 acts through CCR2 in monocyte recruitment 43. Thus, chemotactic regulations in the SCS and medulla diverge. Gene enrichment analysis confirms Ox1 and Ox2 share enrichment in interferon signaling and immune system signatures, but the subsets also display unique ontologies: e.g., Transforming Growth Factor TGF-beta regulation of ECM in Ox1 and response to Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF in Ox2. Several of the observed changes, including induction of Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl20, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10 were observed previously in analyses of bulk LN LECs in response to HSV-1 virus 77 or after ovalbumin specific T-cell responses 11. Our results link inflammation-induced transcriptional changes to specific LEC subsets, implying that niche-specific changes coordinate LEC-driven responses in early inflammation. Interestingly, in both Ox1 and Ox2, significantly more genes are downregulated than upregulated. Pathway analysis shows downregulation of genes associated with viral gene expression, ribosomes and mRNA processing. This may be a result of the activation of type I interferon signaling, which can cause widespread downregulation of host and viral transcriptional and translational pathways as a defense against viral replication 83, 84. Downregulated genes include Csf1 and Ltb, which is interesting from the perspective of the known transient loss of sinusoidal LN macrophages in acute inflammation 18, 19. Core lymphatic endothelial differentiation genes are also downregulated, including Lyve1 and Cldn5, and subset marker genes are inhibited as well. Ox1 shows reduced expression of fLEC marker genes Cd74 and Bmp2, and Ox2 of Ptx3-LEC marker genes including Stab2 and Tgfbi. In addition to IFN-induced transcriptional repression, another contributing factor may be transcription factor availability, which can dictate level of gene expression 85: TNF-induced RELA-dependent pathways, which are also induced as part of the Oxa response, have been shown to redirect cofactors from super-enhancers, repressing cell identity genes in a cell type dependent manner 86. LEC Phenotypes in Human and Mouse LNs Common Mouse and Human LN LEC Phenotypes We have previously reported LEC diversity and described multiple LEC subsets in human LNs 27. Here we compare our mouse LEC samples to a representative sample of human head and neck LN LECs, selected for its quality, high cell number, and inclusion of each of the subsets we identified. We translated human gene names to their mouse homologs, and integrated human and mouse LECs using Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA 87, which implements a variant of the mutual nearest neighbor algorithm MNN 88. Cross mapping successfully aligned human and mouse LECs, and unsupervised clustering of the aligned cells identified shared but also unique subsets in human LN. The five subsets common to mouse and human cLEC, fLEC, Ptx3-LEC, valve-LEC, and Marco-LEC display high correspondence with human LEC subsets defined previously using unsupervised clustering 27 LEC I, II, IV, V, and VI, respectively. Specifically, the Marco-LEC subset of medullary EC maps to human LEC VI, which we previously characterized as medullary sinus CD209 LECs 27. However, mouse Ptx3-LECs map to human LEC IV, which we postulated to be peripheral capillary LECs 27. We discuss this below.. Cross-mapping of mouse and human LNs reveals conserved LEC populations and additional human cLEC subsets. A UMAP of aligned mouse and human LEC, colored by integrated mouse and human LEC subset left and middle, or human LEC ID as in 27 right. Bridge cells are not shown. B Pairwise overlap scores of top 100 subset-specific DEGs for mouse and human LEC. Overlap score is defined as the ratio between the number of shared genes observed and the number of genes expected to be shared by chance. C Correlation of gene profiles of human LEC subsets. Color scale: pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient, calculated using the mean expression of the top 1000 variable genes left. Expression of cLEC subset-specific genes, projected on UMAP plot of human LN LECs right. D Select pathways from Enrichr analysis of DEGs common to mouse and human. Specialization of the Human SCS Ceiling Unsupervised clustering aligned the mouse cLECs with one subset of the human cLECs, core cLECs, which we identified previously as LEC I 27, but additional cLEC subsets cLEC s1, s2, and s3 were unique to the analyzed human LN. Pearson correlation analysis reveals similarity of these subsets with the core cLECs. cLEC s3 is most similar to the core cLEC population as indicated by correlation and hierarchical clustering, UMAP, and differentially expressed genes DEGs data not shown: we do not discuss this subset further. cLEC s1 corresponds to MFAP4 SCS LEC LEC III, which we located overlying the human LN medulla 27. Consistent with this, cLEC s1 clusters close to Ptx3-LECs, and links other cLECs to Ptx3-LECs in trajectory space see below. cLEC s2, which we did not segregate previously, uniquely expresses high levels of Hairyenhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein HEY1, the chemokine CCL2, and E-Selectin SELE data not shown, suggestive of an activated state. Both E-selectin and CCL2 are induced by inflammation in endothelial cells and regulate leukocyte recruitment 89. Based on HEY1 and SELE expression, the subset is identifiable in 3 of the 6 human LN samples we studied previously 27 data not shown. The findings suggest greater heterogeneity and specialization in SCS ceiling LEC in humans than in the resting specific-pathogen-free SPF mice studied here. The subset specialization of human cLEC may relate to local differences in immune environments, or to the more complex architecture of the human LN. Unlike the mouse, human cLECs participate in invaginations of the capsule, known as trabecular sinuses 4, which may experience more turbulent flow of the incoming lymph and hence variation in shear stress. Comparisons of Human and Mouse LEC Differentially Expressed Genes DEG To evaluate similarities between species, we compared DEGs of mouse and human LEC subsets using a gene overlap score, defined as the ratio of the number of shared DEGs to the number of genes expected to be shared based on random chance, for each combination of mouse and human subsets. In all instances, the highest overlap scores are seen between corresponding subsets. Based on overlap scores, cLECs are more conserved than the more immunologically active subsets fLECs, Marco-LECs, and Ptx3-LECs. The floor and medullary sinus subsets showed less conserved DEG profiles, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure in response to pathogens, contrasting with conservation of structural functions of cLECs. Gene set enrichment analysis based on conserved genes has the potential to highlight core functions of the LEC subsets. Shared cLEC genes are involved in focal adhesion, fluid shear stress response and ECM interaction, consistent with their structural role and association to the capsule. Ptx3-LECs are enriched in genes for endocytosis and lysosome, which could relate to the high expression of scavenger receptors e.g., Lyve1, Stab1, Stab2. Marco-LECs are enriched for lysosomal genes, and for genes of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway as well as the coagulation and complement cascades. fLECs display high enrichment for inflammatory pathways, including JAK-STAT and Nuclear Factor NF-kappa B, and are enriched for genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, supporting their immunomodulatory properties. A number of mouse key subset specific marker DEGs are shared in the human, including fLECs: Bmp2, Ccl20, Cd74, and Csf1; cLECs: Ackr4, Bmp4, and Cav1; Marco-LECs: Marco, Clec4g, and C2; and Ptx3-LECs: Ptx3, Nrp2, and Flt4 Vegfr3. We illustrate expression of these and other select shared marker genes in.. Conserved gene programs for mouse and human LEC specialization. Expression of select gene homologs or paralogs Itih5 and ITIH3 in cLECs, fLECs, Ptx3-LECs, Marco-LECs and valve LECs. Color indicates subset mean log transcript count, normalized within each subset. Dot size indicates subset mean log transcript count, scaled to the maximum value for each gene. As noted above, mouse Marco-LECs align with LEC VI, which we identified previously as the major medullary sinus subset in human LNs 27. Unexpectedly, mouse Ptx3-LECs align with a subset LEC IV that we previously related to capillary LECs based on their enrichment for expression of Ccl21 and Lyve1 27, gene markers of peripheral capillary lymphatic vessels 57, 58. However, these genes are also expressed by mouse Ptx3-LECs Figures 1D, 5B, 8, and as noted earlier, their expression likely reflects the parallels with capillary LEC in morphology blind ends, loose EC junctions and function recruiting fluid and lymphocytes into lymph 4. Supporting a medullary identity, Ptx3-LECs and LEC IV share high levels the sinusoidal endothelial marker Stab2STAB2 46, shown to be expressed by medullary sinuses in human LNs 90. Importantly, human Ptx3-LECs LEC IV also share expression of PTX3 and lack PD-L1 CD274 expression, similar to their mouse counterpart; and they express the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor gene family member ITIH3, functionally related to the mouse Ptx3-LEC marker Itih5 64. Ptx3-LECs in both humans and mice are distinguished from Marco-LECs by higher expression of the glycoprotein and scavenger receptor CD36, also known as Fatty Acid Translocase FAT. Staining of CD36 in human head and neck LNs identified capillary-like, CD36high LYVE-1 lymphatic cords, negative for MARCO and the Marco-LEC LEC VI 27 marker CLEC4M Figures 9B,C. These CD36high lymphatic sinuses were found either as isolated cords in the paracortex Figures 9B,C or as extended sprouts from MARCO CLEC4M medullary sinuses, similar to mouse Ptx3-LECs which connects to Marco-LECs in perifollicular regions. Human Ptx3-LECs are also distinguished from Marco-LECs by high expression of PDPN and CCL21, as predicted by the transcriptional profiles Figure S8, while both medullary subsets express LYVE-1 and STAB2 Figure S8. Thus, cross-species comparison of single-cell profiles and in situ analysis support that human and mouse share two distinct niches of paracortical and medullary sinus LECs: MARCO LECs, which correspond to the previously published CD209 medullary sinus LEC subset LEC VI 27, and Ptx3-LECs, PDPNhigh, CD36high paracortical and medullary sinus LECs, corresponding to LEC IV 27 in our earlier classification of human LN LECs. Notably, human and mouse LN LECs also share the in situ physical transition between Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs, as predicted in trajectory analysis Figures 1C, 10A, discussed below..

B Expression pattern of indicated genes. Marco-LEC, Ptx3-LEC, and cLEC s1 populations are highlighted. Values are batch-corrected imputed log counts. Species-Specific Gene Expression A number of genes with homologs in mouse and human are not conserved in expression, or display different patterns of subset selectivity. Here we highlight select examples for discussion Figure S9. As noted earlier, the mouse fLEC markers Madcam1 and Msr1 are poorly expressed by human LECs 27 data not shown. ACKR1, also known as DARC Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines, marks human fLECs and Marco-LECs, but Ackr1 has very low expression in mouse LN LECs, without clear subset selectivity Figure S9B. Consistent with this, endothelial ACKR1 in mouse is restricted to venular blood vessels, with only sparse and low detection in LECs 91. ACKR1 is a chemokine interceptor, which can serve as a sink for a large range of inflammatory chemokines 92. Its expression could reflect a greater need to moderate inflammatory chemokines in the human. Alternatively, it may facilitate transport of chemokines across the lymphatic endothelium in the human LN, as ACKR1 has been shown to shuttle chemokines across endothelial cell layers 93. Several ACKR1 ligands are expressed by human fLECs including CXCL3 and CXCL5 27. Human but not mouse LN LECs also display high expression of IL6 in fLECs Figure S9B, likely reflecting a higher inflammatory basal state in human, especially compared to our SPF mice. Human Ptx3-LECs express MMP2 and LOX, genes missing in mouse LECs or expressed in different subsets i.e., Lox expressed weakly in cLECs in mouse Figure S9B. Both Matrix metalloproteinase 2 MMP2 and Lysyl oxidase LOX can contribute to ECM modulation 94, 95, suggesting that, although matrix interplay is conserved, the specific mechanisms of matrix interaction in this population of LECs may have diverged. Mouse-specific LN LEC DEGs include Apolipoprotein E ApoE in cLECs and medullary sinus populations and Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 Rgs4 in fLECs Figure S9B. Carboxypeptidase E Cpe and Carbonic anhydrase 8 Car8 are examples of genes with different expression pattern across mouse and mouse LN LEC subsets Figure S9B. Since scRNA-seq is often unable to detect low abundance transcripts, the apparent lack of expression of a gene must be interpreted with caution: the expression pattern of the genes mentioned here have been observed in each of our samples. In addition, CD209 and CLEC4M, which lack orthologs in mouse 27, are specific for human Marco-LECs. We described them previously as medullary sinus markers 27. Human IL32 and mouse Glycam1 also lack orthologs. IL-32 potently amplifies inflammatory responses by induction of multiple cytokines 96; it is highly expressed by human Ptx3-LECs data not shown. GLYCAM1, a secreted mucin that on high endothelial venules is decorated with glycotopes for leukocyte selectins 97, is selectively expressed by mouse fLEC and Figure S4. The Continuum of Human LEC Phenotypes in Trajectory Space We have focused to this point on comparing subsets of human and mouse LECs, but as illustrated for the mouse, LECs exist in a phenotypic continuum that may reflect physical alignments spatial transitions, developmental sequences, or both. To gain further insight into LEC diversity and zonation within human LNs, we ran tSpace on combined LN LECs from our six previously published human samples 27. In the tSpace projections in, cell identities are determined based on correlation with the core subsets in our index human LN left or based on unsupervised clustering as previously 27 right. Alignment of human LECs in trajectory space reveals both similarities and differences to the mouse. Shared subsets are aligned in the same order as in the mouse, with links from Valve-LECs to cLECs, Ptx3-LECs, Marco-LECs and finally fLECs compare with mouse alignments in Figures 1B,C. However, in the human, the cellular bridge between cLECs and fLECs is highly populated with cells. The human-specific cLEC subsets also show interesting alignments. cLEC s2 appears closely linked to the bridge. cLEC s1, which we previously identified as SCS ceiling LEC overlying the medulla LEC III 27, extends toward and links prominently to Ptx3-LECs see arrows: Cells from both subsets within this Ptx3-LECs-to-cLEC s1 trajectory express PTX3 itself, and are highly enriched in CCL21, suggesting a relationship of PTX3 medullary sinuses and the perihilar ceiling. Supporting this notion, RNAscope of a neonatal human LN showed extensive PTX3 in the medulla of the hilar region data not shown. Co-expression of CCL21 and SPHK1 enzyme required for S1P production support a role of Ptx3-LECs in lymphocyte egress. Heterogeneity in ANGPT2 also exists along the Ptx3-LEC paths. The alignments outlined here are not an artifact of the high cell number or integration of LEC from different LNs, because the same patterns and linkages are seen in independent tSpace projections of our index LN sample not shown. Human LN LECs thus display numerous intermediate phenotypes and complex zonation that may reflect the complexity of human LN architecture observed histologically. Summary and Outlook The LN lymphatic vasculature provides a complex lymphatic vascular bed, adapted to a unique microenvironment where cooperation between stromal cells and immune cells forms the basis for effective immune cell interaction and activation. Endothelial cells in this environment not only need to provide a framework for the structural organization of the organ, but also need to be able to adapt to constant changes induced by immunological stimuli and organ expansion in LN hypertrophy, and to support tolerogenic immune reactions in homeostasis. We define five LN LEC subsets in mouse: valve LECs, the SCS Ackr4 cLECs, the immune active Ccl20 fLECs, as well as Ptx3-LECs and Marco-LECs, two paracortical and medullary sinus subsets that were not recognized previously. Single-cell gene profiles indicate niche-specific functional specialization of these subsets with distinct pathways for pathogen interactions and matrix modeling. Interestingly, cross-species mapping with human LN LECs shows that both subsets as well as their respective functions are conserved, which allows us to redefine the subset previously identified as candidate capillary LECs LEC IV 27 in human LN to paracortical sinus Ptx3-LECs. PTX3 and MARCO, gene markers chosen here to designate the two distinct medullary LEC subsets, are conserved both in their expression patterns among LEC subsets and also in protein sequence between humans and mice 92 homology PTX3 and 69 MARCO, suggesting that they may have conserved functions as well. Recently developed algorithms have made important advances in solving the complex problem of integrating different datasets 8799. As shown here, they not only perform well in combining sample replicates by removing batch effects, but can also identify and map similar subsets of cells across species barriers. Mutual nearest neighbors and CCA algorithms not only mapped human LEC subsets to mouse counterparts, but also uncovered species-specific LN LEC subset compositions, revealing a greater diversity of SCS ceiling LEC in human. We can look forward to continuing advances in computational approaches to integrating and mining scRNA-seq data. Particularly exciting is the power of trajectory inference to recapitulate or predict the organization of endothelial cells within the complex vascular networks. While trajectory analysis has been shown to model sequences of cell phenotypes in development pseudotime 30, our results both in lymphatics here and blood vascular EC studies 31 show that computed alignments of cells in trajectory space reflect the tissue architecture spatial organization and physical relationships between endothelial cells in situ with surprising faithfulness. This correspondence implies, as an approximation, that endothelial cell phenotypes progress in a gradual and orderly fashion within the linear arrangements as in vascular tubes or sheets as in the SCS and sinus-lining LECs in the LN that make up the endothelium. In essence, trajectories provide a computational roadmap for mapping gene expression to the vascular endothelium. The results underscore the diversity of endothelial cells as a continuum, punctuated by concentrations of particular phenotypes or niches that are identified as subsets. Whether the progression of phenotypes and zonation among LN LECs reflects malleable LEC responses to local niche factors, retention of a programmed developmental response, or both, remains to be determined. Our studies here demonstrate the power of single-cell profiling to illuminate the biology of the vascular endothelium, and the promise it holds to revolutionize our understanding of conserved and species-specific regulation of the vasculature and its responses in physiology and human disease. Materials and Methods Mice Male and female 68-week-old BALBcJ or 812-week-old C57BL6J peripheral LNs inguinal, axillary and brachial processed by 10x Genomics workflow, or 20-week-old Prox1-GFPC57BL6J 33 female inguinal LNs processed by SMART-seq2 workflow were used for scRNA-seq. Mice were bred and maintained in the animal facilities at Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal. In addition, mice were held at a Specific Pathogen Free SPF facility Uppsala University, and experimental procedures were approved by the local animal ethics committee at the Uppsala County Court 600917. Immune Challenge BALBcJ mice were subjected to cutaneous Oxazolone Oxa challenge by applying 5 4-Ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one Sigma-Aldrich in acetone and olive oil topical to the skin as described 73. Axillary, brachial, and inguinal draining LNs were harvested 48 h after immunization. Tissue Dissociation and Single-Cell Library Preparation Cell isolation for 10x: Single-cell suspensions of total EC were generated as previously described 100. For each group, axillary, inguinal, and brachial LNs from 25 to 30 male and female BALBcJ or C57BL6J mice were combined, minced, washed with Hanks Balanced Salt solution, and dissociated for 30 min at 37C with gentle rocking in HBSS with calcium and magnesium medium containing 0.2 mgml Collagenase P, 0.8 mgml Dispase II, and 0.01 mgml DNase I Sigma-Aldrich adapted from 14. Hematopoietic cells were depleted with anti-CD45 mouse MicroBeads according to the manufacturers protocol Miltenyi and the remaining cells were stained with anti-CD31 BV605 clone 390 and anti-PDPN PE-Cy7 clone 8.1.1 antibodies, as well as dump antibodies consisting of anti-CD45 clone 30-F11, anti-EpCAM clone G8.8, anti-TER119 clone TER-119, anti-CD11a clone H155-78, and anti-CD11b clone M170 in PerCP-Cy5.5. Total EC lin CD31 were sorted into 100 fetal bovine serum using FACS Aria III BD Biosciences; 100 um nozzle; 2,500 cellss, washed, and immediately processed to generate scRNA-seq library using Chromium Single Cell 3 Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 10x Genomics according to manufacturers instructions. Libraries were sequenced with NextSeq 500 Illumina using 150 cycles high output V2 kit Read 1: 26 bp, Read 2: 98 bp at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility. Cell isolation for SMART-seq2: Inguinal LN digests from Prox1-GFP mice 33, depleted for hematopoietic cells as described above, were stained with anti-CD31 PE-Cy7 clone 390, anti-PDPN AF660 clone eBio8.11 antibodies Thermo Fisher Scientific. Dump channel included anti-mouse TER-119 eFluor450 clone Ter119, anti-mouse CD45 eFluor450 clone 30-F11, anti-mouse CD11b eFluor450 clone M170, and dead cell staining SYTOX Blue Thermo Fisher Scientific. Triple positive live cells GFP PDPN CD31 LECs were gated and sorted on a BD FACSAria III BD Biosciences 100 um nozzle, 20 psi as single cells into a 384 well plate with lysis buffer. Single cell libraries were prepared as described and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 101. Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Analysis 10x Genomics: Read alignment and quality control were performed using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v3.0.2 and the mm10 reference genome. Loupe Cell Browser v3.1.1; 10x Genomics was used to manually gate on LEC Pdpn CD31 for downstream analysis. SMART-seq2: After lane demultiplexing, SMART-seq2 based FASTQ files were trimmed with Trim Galore v0.4.4 followed by alignment of the data to the mouse reference genome mm10-GRCm38 using TopHat v2.1.1 and bowtie2 v2.2.6.0. PCR duplicates were removed using SAMtools v0.1.18. Counting of fragments aligning per gene was done using the featurecounts function of the Subread package v1.4.6-p5. Count data were processed with the Seurat package v3.1.0 87, 99. For quality control, genes that were expressed in fewer than three cells and cells that expressed fewer than 100 genes were excluded from analysis. Raw counts were log normalized, and 2000 most variable genes were identified based on a variance stabilizing transformation. To correct for batch differences, variable gene sets were used to align multiple datasets for joint analysis, using the Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA method within the FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions of the Seurat package, which implements a variant of the mutual nearest neighbors MNN algorithm. Correspondences between single cells across datasets were identified and multiple datasets were transformed into a shared space. Principal Component Analysis PCA dimensionality reduction was performed using the variable gene sets. Cell clusters were determined using a Shared Nearest Neighbor SNN modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm of the Seurat FindClusters function, and were visualized with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding tSNE 102 or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP 103. Contaminating pericyte, immune and blood endothelial cells were removed by supervised gating on the tSNE plot. To recover gene-gene relationships that are lost due to dropouts, we imputed missing gene expression data from log normalized count data using an in-house customization https:github.comkbruloismagicBatch of the MAGIC Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells algorithm with optimized parameters t  2, k  9, ka  3 104. Imputed data were used for visualization of single-cell gene expression in violin plots and heatmaps 105, as well as for trajectory analyses. Nearest Neighbor Alignments in Trajectory Space tSpace was used to model the nearest neighbor relationships as well as transitional zones between LEC subsets 30. Mapping of cells in trajectory space allows unsupervised reconstruction and exploration of complex developmental sequences, without implementation of cell clustering or manifold distortion for graphical expedience. Batch effects were removed using the fastMNN function of the batchelor package v1.0.1 88 and variable genes were identified using the scran package 106. For mouse LEC, we used tSpace with default parameters T  100, K  20, 5 graphs, 20 way points, Euclidean distance metric and imputed expression values of the top 800 variable genes Figures 1C, 6A, right panel or batch-corrected low-dimensional coordinates top 50 coordinates, left panel. The trajectory matrices were visualized in low dimensional space using PCA Figures 1C, 6A, right panel or UMAP, left panel within the tSpace package. For combined human LEC samples, imputed data of LEC from 6 LNs were batch-corrected as above. Twenty PCs from the 1000 variable genes were calculated, the loadings were adjusted to a minimum value of 0 by addition of a constant and used as input to the tSpace algorithm T  200, K  25, 5 graphs, 10-way points, cosine distance metric. Differential Gene Expression and Gene Enrichment Analysis Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the negative binomial generalized linear model within the FindMarkers function of Seurat on log normalized count data p  0.01, fold change  1.2. To identify subset-defining genes, single-cell transcriptomes of cells in the subset of interest were compared to those of all other cells within the same sample. Only upregulated DEGs were considered, unless otherwise specified. Gene enrichment analysis of DEGs with Gene Ontology 107, 108, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 109, 110, and BioPlanet 111 databases was performed using Enrichr 112, 113. Correlation Analysis To determine similarities between LEC subsets, mean gene expression values were calculated for each subset. The top 1000 most variable genes across all subsets were used for pairwise Pearson correlation analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the average linkage method. Cross Species Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Human HNLN1 dataset GSE124494 27 was used for the integrated LEC profiling. Human gene names were converted to their mouse homologs using the biomaRt package v2.40.4 114. scRNA-seq datasets were integrated in Seurat for unsupervised clustering. The top 100 most upregulated DEGs for each subset, as ranked by the fold change of gene expression in the subset relative to other LEC combined, were determined for human LEC and separately for mouse. An overlap score was defined as the number of DEGs common to one human subset and one mouse subset divided by the number of genes expected to be shared by the two subsets by chance. For each pair of mouse subset and human subsets, overlap score  n  A  B  N, where n  number of observed overlapping genes between the top 100 DEGs of the human subset and the mouse subset, A  number of DEGs considered in the mouse subset 100, B  number of DEGs considered in the human subset with mouse homologs, and N  total number of genes detected in both mouse and human LEC, 13,458. Reanalysis of Human LEC Datasets For the combined analysis of human LEC samples 27, imputed gene expression data were batch-corrected and used for trajectory analysis as above. LEC in each of the additional five human samples were classified by correspondence to the index human subsets that mapped with mouse subsets as follows: reference subset mean gene expression was generated from the index HNLN1 human dataset, using core cells of each major subset that cross-mapped with mouse subsets, as well as manually gated bridge cells that link fLEC and cLEC in tSpace projections. Cells in the other human samples were classified by Pearson correlation using the 1000 most variable genes in the reference set. Immunostaining of Mouse LNs Inguinal and popliteal mouse LNs were harvested from Prox1-GFP mice 33 and fixed in 0.8 paraformaldehyde PFA for 12 h at 4C.

Single-cell transcriptomics promise to revolutionize our understanding of the vasculature. Emerging computational methods applied to high-dimensional single-cell data allow integration of results between samples and species and illuminate the diversity and underlying developmental and architectural organization of cell populations.

Clustering identifies five well-delineated subsets, including two medullary sinus subsets not previously recognized as distinct. Nearest neighbor alignments in trajectory space position the major subsets in a sequence that recapitulates the known features and suggests novel features of LN lymphatic organization, providing a transcriptional map of the lymphatic endothelial niches and of the transitions between them. Differences in gene expression reveal specialized programs for 1 subcapsular ceiling endothelial interactions with the capsule connective tissue and cells; 2 subcapsular floor regulation of lymph borne cell entry into the LN parenchyma and antigen presentation; and 3 pathogen interactions and 4 LN remodeling in distinct medullary subsets. LEC of the subcapsular sinus floor and medulla, which represent major sites of cell entry and exit from the LN parenchyma respectively, respond robustly to oxazolone inflammation challenge with enriched signaling pathways that converge on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Integration of mouse and human single-cell profiles reveals a conserved cross-species pattern of lymphatic vascular niches and gene expression, as well as specialized human subsets and genes unique to each species. The examples provided demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis in elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, vascular organization, and endothelial cell responses. We discuss the findings from the perspective of LEC functions in relation to niche formations in the unique stromal and highly immunological environment of the LN. ORIGINAL RESEARCH article Front.

Introduction Lymph nodes LNs serve as hubs for the interaction and communication between tissue-derived and blood-derived immune cells 1. Integrated along the large collecting lymphatic vessels, they are vital sensors of tissue damage, constantly sampling the incoming lymph 2. The LN comprises a complex network of lymphatic sinuses surrounding a dense parenchyma, which mainly consists of immune cells but also specialized blood vessels and a network of mesenchymal cells 13. Segregated B cell cortex and T cell paracortex areas characterize the LN architecture 4. It is well-established that the LN stromal cells play a central role in maintaining both this structure and the immunological functions of the LN, providing chemotactic cues, cytokines, and a structural reticular framework that guide immune cell positioning, migration, survival, and activation reviews: 3, 5. Single-cell sequencing has enabled delineation of nine distinct clusters of murine LN mesenchymal cell phenotypes 6 underlining the complexity needed to maintain the LN structure and coordinate immunity. The lymphatic vasculature is the first structural component of the LN encountered by incoming lymph-borne molecules or cells. Recent studies have revealed an intriguing regional specialization and cellular heterogeneity that characterize the LN lymphatic endothelium and differentiate the LN lymphatic endothelial cells LECs from LECs in peripheral lymphatic vessels 712. Subset-specific markers with functional implications include the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR4 also known as CCRL1, specifically expressed by the LEC layer that forms the ceiling cLECs of the subcapsular sinus SCS 9, where lymph enters from the afferent collecting vessels. ACKR4 is a scavenger receptor for the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CCL25 13 and controls entry of tissue-derived dendritic cells DCs into the LN through controlling the formation of CCL21 chemokine gradients across the SCS 9. Leukocyte entry occurs primarily through the SCS floor LECs fLECs, which in mouse express the mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 MAdCAM-1 7, 14 among other adhesion and attractant molecules that can control leukocyte transmigration 7, 15. The SCS also functions as a physical barrier and gateway, enabling size-restricted access of antigens to the LN parenchyma 16: the glycoprotein plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein PLVAP, together with cLEC-expressed caveolin 1 CAV1 10, form sieve-like diaphragms in the transendothelial channels that bridge the SCS to the conduit system and descend from the SCS floor 10. This structural barrier is complemented by a dense network of macrophages closely associated with SCS, providing essential innate immune functions and a filtering system for pathogens 17. The SCS and medullary sinus macrophage niches in the LN were recently shown to be dependent on LEC-expressed CSF-1 colony stimulating factor 1 18 and receptor activator of nuclear factor \u03ba B RANKRANKL signaling between the LN LECs and SCS lining mesenchymal cells 19. LN LECs can also directly influence adaptive immune responses, either through presentation of tissue antigens, which contributes to the maintenance of peripheral tolerance 2022, or by serving as reservoirs for antigens 23. LN LECs express the immune-checkpoint ligand programmed death-ligand 1 PD-L1 also known as CD274 7, 24, an inhibitor of T cell activation, and lack expression of co-stimulatory genes 24, which may explain their role in tolerance. PD-L1 is expressed selectively in the floor of the SCS fLECs, cortical sinuses, and parts of the medulla 7, 24. Genes that influence the communication between LECs and their surroundings could contribute to endothelial regulation as well, and interestingly, PD-L1 expression moderates proliferation and enhances survival of LN LECs in inflammation 25. The diverse and site-specific specialization of the LN lymphatic endothelium is at least partly dependent on crosstalk with immune cells, with contributions from B cells, T cells 7, 26, and mesenchymal stromal cells 19. Hence, the LNs provide both a unique model system to explore endothelial cell interactions with their surroundings and a model for exploring endothelial diversity and phenotypic plasticity. Our recent single-cell analysis of the human LN LECs revealed the complexity and specialization of the LN lymphatic endothelium in man 27. A detailed profiling of the mouse lymphatic endothelium and comparison of human and mouse LN lymphatic endothelium is still missing. Here we provide single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the mouse LN lymphatic vasculature. We show that computational alignments relationships revealed by nearest neighbor trajectory inference recapitulate key aspects of the tissue architecture and predict physical relationships between LN LECs in the tissue, illustrating the power of single-cell analysis for understanding the organization of the vascular endothelium. Cross-species analyses further allowed us to define conserved and divergent LEC phenotypes and lymphatic vascular niches. Notably, the analysis delineates two specialized subsets of medullary sinus LECs, present in both mouse and human that are distinct in gene expression and location in the LN. Using the mouse LN response to cutaneous oxazolone as a model, we show that sites of immune cell entry and exit from the LN, fLECs, and paracortical sinuses, respectively, respond rapidly to inflammation, whereas structurally important cLECs are less affected. Together, the results demonstrate the power of bioinformatic tools for elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, physical relationships, and cellular responses in complex vascular beds, and provide a basis for future detailed analysis of human and mouse LN LEC responses in disease. Results and Discussion Single-Cell Trajectories Model Tissue Architecture and Physical Relationships Between LN LECs To assess the heterogeneity of the lymphatic vasculature and the relationships between lymphatic vascular niches, we analyzed lin podoplanin PDPN CD31 cells from mouse peripheral LNs i.e., axillary, brachial and inguinal by single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics system. An independent set of LN LECs was sorted as single cells and subjected to SMART-seq2 analysis 28. Prospero homeobox protein 1 Prox1 was used as a pan-LEC marker in the analysis 29. Blood endothelial cells Flt1Ly6c1, immune cells Cd45, and pericytes Pdgfra or Pdgfrb were identified by marker gene expression and excluded from further analysis. We used a combination of unsupervised clustering and graph-based methods to determine LEC subsets; Methods.. Mouse LN LEC subsets revealed by 10x and SMART-seq2. A Experimental workflow. Mouse peripheral LNs were isolated and dissociated into single-cell suspensions. Hematopoietic cells were MACS-depleted, and EC linCD31 were FACS-sorted for single-cell sequencing using the droplet-based 10x Genomics system or the SMART-seq2 workflow figure created with BioRender.com. B tSNE plots of 4252 LECs processed by 10x left and 383 LECs by SMART-seq2 right. Cells are colored by subset. Numbers indicate the continuum of the lymphatic endothelium. C tSpace analysis of single-cell trajectories depicting nearest neighbor alignments of LECs. D Expression of LEC subset defining genes in C57BL6 mouse 10x. Dots indicate mean log-normalized transcript count. In addition to gene profile-based dimensionality reduction with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding tSNE and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP see below, we used a trajectory analysis algorithm, tSpace 30, to define high dimensional nearest neighbor alignments that emphasize the continuum of cell phenotypes and reveal transitions between related cells. In developing cell systems, trajectory inference methods can model developmental sequence pseudotime 30. In the resting adult vascular endothelium, they facilitate computational modeling of vessel architecture 27, 31. Subsets and alignments were shared in mice with different genetic backgrounds C57BL6 and BALBc Figure S1A. Cells from both male and female mice were represented in the dataset and comprised similar phenotypes Figure S1B. However, the study was not designed or powered to examine strain- or sex-dependent differences in LN LECs, and these remain to be further explored. Our analyses identified major clusters representing LN cLECs and fLECs based on the expression of known SCS ceiling marker Ackr4 9 as well as SCS floor markers Madcam1 7, 14 and the chemokine Ccl20 15, 27 and Figure S1C. Candidate valve-related LECs display high expression of known lymphatic valve markers, including the transcription factor Forkhead box protein C2 Foxc2 32 and Figure S1C. A minor cluster, most apparent in tSpace projections and associated with valve, expressed higher levels of peripheral lymphatic vessels markers including lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 Lyve1 and the chemokine Ccl21, together with lower expression of Foxc2 compared to the candidate valve LECs. This population likely represents collector or pre-collector LECs 2, 32. These subsets were poorly represented in our data and we discuss them in the context of the architecture of LN LECs, but exclude them from detailed differential gene expression analyses below. Unsupervised clusters separate Lyve1 high candidate medullary sinus LEC into two subsets, referred to here as Ptx3-LECs Ptx3 and Marco-LECs Marco and Figure S1C. Alignment of LECs in tSpace visualization recapitulates known connections within the complex lymphatic endothelial network in LN and reveals previously unappreciated relationships as well as intermediate, putative transitional phenotypes. In addition to the subsets identified by clustering, we highlight two transitional populations here, for discussion below. Transition zone tzLECs comprise a link between fLECs and Marco-LECs in tSpace. Additionally, a minor bridge population B aligns along a direct path between fLECs and cLECs in tSpace projection. As emphasized by numbering of subsets in and illustrated schematically in, trajectories starting from candidate collecting LECs 1 lead prominently to valve 2 and to SCS ceiling LEC 3, consistent with their known physical connections. cLECs branch to fLECs through the bridging population B but also transition prominently to Ptx3-LECs 4, Ptx3-LECs to Marco-LECs 5, and Marco-LECs via tzLECs 6 to fLEC 7 along a phenotypic sequence or path that is well-represented in all LEC datasets here. In situ Localization of LN LEC Subsets To define LEC subsets and their niches in situ, we carried out immunofluorescence staining using antibodies to subset differentiating markers predicted from gene expression in inguinal LNs of Prox1-GFP reporter mice 33, where all LECs express the fluorescent reporter GFP. scRNA-seq predicts that LYVE-1 is absent in cLECs and low in fLECs, but is highly expressed in Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs. Staining for LYVE-1 highlights the cortical, paracortical, and entire medullary region of mouse inguinal LN Figures 2A,B. Expression of Cd274, which encodes the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1, distinguishes fLECs, Marco-LECs, and tzLECs Cd274high from Ptx3-LECs Cd274low and Figure S1C. Co-immunostaining of PD-L1 and LYVE-1 shows that PD-L1 expression defines the fLECs and discrete regions of LYVE-1high medullary sinus LECs that are distant from the hilus. Expression of Marco, which encodes the scavenger receptor Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous Structure MARCO, is highly selective for Marco-LECs: MARCO is a known medullary sinus marker in human LN 27, 34. We show that MARCO expression pattern in the mouse LN medulla selectively overlaps with that of PD-L1. Conversely, in situ hybridization for Ptx3 RNAscope specifically outlines the central medullary sinuses with particularly strong signals in the paracortical cords Figures 3A,B, overlapping with the area of LYVE-1high PD-L1 MARCO cords outlined by protein staining. Co-staining of MARCO and the B-cell marker B220 shows that MARCOhigh regions start from the cortical areas defined based on presence of B-cell follicles and extend into the peri-follicular medulla of both inguinal and popliteal LNs Figure S2. The PD-L1, MARCO sinuses Ptx3-LECs are instead associated with a network of scattered B lineage cells Figure S2, a typical feature of the medullary region in the LN, where the lymphatic cords are surrounded by plasma cells 4, 35. Trajectory analysis predicts that Ptx3-LECs are contiguous with the SCS ceiling, which is also evident along the efferent side of the LN where the LYVE-1 outermost endothelial layers cLECs connect to the LYVE-1 cords i.e., Ptx3-LECs Figure S3..

As noted above, trajectory analysis predicts a close relationship between Marco-LECs and fLECs, and identifies a transitional population tzLECs between them. tzLECs are characterized by variable and often intermediate expression of fLEC e.g., Madcam1 and Ccl20 and Marco-LEC associated genes e.g. Marco and Lyve1. Histologic analysis identifies a region of LECs between fLECs and Marco-LECs that displays expression patterns consistent with this transitional phenotype. Cells of this phenotype can be observed between the fLECs and Marco-LECs in the region between the bilateral lobes of the inguinal LN and at the LN margins, where the lining cells display reduced MAdCAM-1 compared to the majority of fLEC and increasing levels of LYVE-1. Few if any genes are specific to tzLECs i.e., not shared with fLECs or Marco-LECs, and unbiased non-negative matrix factorization does not identify a gene set specific to the subset data not shown. Thus, the tzLECs highlighted here are part of a continuum between fLEC and Marco-LEC populations, defining an area of vascular zonation. Consistent with computational predictions, the results favor a model in which Marco-LECs occupy the perifollicular medulla in association to the LN cortex, with the transitional phenotype tzLECs bridging them to the SCS floor..

B Heatmap of selected DEGs in the C57BL6 mouse 10x LN LEC subsets. Values are imputed log counts row scaled. Hence, we have demonstrated the organization of LEC in situ, with SCS ceiling converging on Ptx3-LECs, Ptx3-LECs to Marco-LECs and tzLECs, then leading to fLECs Figures 24, which mirrors the phenotypic progression revealed by trajectory analysis. A schematic of the LN LEC connections is shown in. LEC Molecular Phenotypes Correspond With Their Vascular Niches and Functions The cLEC Molecular Profile Reflects Interaction With the LN Capsule cLECs connect to afferent and efferent collecting vessels, and co-express several genes with valve-related LECs, including higher levels of Foxc2 36 compared to other LN subsets and Figure S1C. Deletion of Foxc2 in lymphatic vessels has been shown to lead to downregulation of the cLEC marker Ackr4, but also to mislocation of surrounding smooth muscle cells 36. cLECs interact physically with the relatively rigid capsule that surrounds LNs. The capsule is a dense network of connective tissue and hence is a unique extracellular matrix ECM, distinct from other parts of the LN 4. Reflecting this, cLECs are highly enriched for genes encoding ECM proteins, Multimerin protein 1 and 2 Mmrn1 and Mmrn2, together with high levels of Platelet-derived growth factor a and b Pdgfa and Pdgfb, Jagged-1 Jag1 a ligand for Notch receptors on both endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and Endothelin 1 Edn1 a vasoactive peptide and known lymphatic constrictor, proteins known to maintain interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells 37, 38 and Figure S4. The capsule was recently shown to have a CD34 stromal cell subset with expression of CD248 6, a ligand for MMRN2. MMRN2 can also interact with cLEC expressed MMRN2-ligand Cd93, which was recently coupled to ECM fibrillogenesis in tumor blood endothelium 39. cLECs express the BMP family members Growth differentiation factor 10 Gdf10 and the Bone morphogenic protein 4 Bmp4, which differentiate cLECs from fLECs as well as bridging cells in the SCS and Figures S4, S5. fLEC instead express Bmp2 and Figures S4, S5. The expression of BMPs may mediate both autocrine and paracrine signaling to the surrounding stromal and immune cells. fLECs: An Immune-Active Subset fLECs are the gatekeeper for lymph-derived immune cell entry into the lymph node parenchyma. In keeping with this role, fLECs are characterized by genes involved in immune cell adhesion including Madcam1, Icam1, Vcam1, and Glycam1, supporting active immune cell migration Figures 1D, 5B and Figure S4. These adhesion receptors may also help retain the closely associated SCS macrophages 17. fLECs are also enriched for chemokines, including the known fLEC marker Ccl20 CCR6 ligand 15, 27 but also Cxcl1 CXCR2 ligand Figures 1D, 5B and Figure S4. CCL20 has been linked to innate lymphoid cell ILC trafficking across the SCS 15 and may affect the cross-talk between CCR6-positive DCs and LECs in antigen presentation 40. CCL20 could also influence B cell homeostasis, as memory B cell precursors are distinguished by high CCR6 expression in lymphoid organs of both mouse and man 41 and are closely associated to the SCS 42. CXCL1 may instead contribute to neutrophil migration and recruitment 43. fLECs and Marco-LECs, both macrophage-rich niches 17, share high expression of Csf1 and Figure S4, and fLECs express Platelet factor 4 Pf4 also known as CXCL4 and Figure S4. CSF-1 and CXCL4 both regulate monocyte and macrophage functions 18, 44 and LEC-derived CSF-1 is required to maintain the LN macrophage niches 18. As mentioned earlier, Bmp2 is specifically expressed by fLECs and Figures S4, S5 that are also enriched for both Smad1 and Smad4 and Figure S4 suggesting a role for BMP-signaling in fLEC homeostasis. Another distinguishing feature of fLECs is their expression of CD74 and Figure S4, the MHC class II-associated invariant chain. CD74 is involved in the formation and transport of MHC class II-antigen complexes 45. Together with high levels of H2-Ab1 and Figure S4, this supports a major role of this subset in LN LEC-mediated antigen presentation. Together with the high expression of PD-L1 Cd274 in fLECs Figures 2, 5B and Figure S4, and given that antigens are continuously transported from afferent lymphatics into the SCS, this places the fLECs as the major niche for LN LEC-mediated tolerance. In contrast to all other subsets, fLECs and tzLECs lacks detectable expression of the scavenger receptor Stabilin 2 Stab2, a sinusoidal endothelial marker 46, and have low expression of the tight junction protein Claudin 5 Cldn5 and Figures S4, S6. The latter suggests that junctional properties of the fLECs differ compared to other LN LECs and may reflect requirements for the active immune migration at this site. Marco-LECs: MARCO Medullary Sinus LECs Immunofluorescence staining for MARCO in mouse inguinal LN shows that it delineates the medullary sinuses adjacent to the B cell follicles in the LN cortex perifollicular sinuses. MARCO expression coincides with PD-L1 expression in the medullary sinuses, and is excluded from the PD-L1 negative medullary sinuses closest to the hilus and Figure S2. Lymph from SCS passes through this lymphatic meshwork, abundant in macrophages that can capture lymph-borne pathogens 17, 47. While MARCO is also marker for medullary macrophages 47, a major part of the MARCO expression within the adult LN is however confined to LECs. MARCO expression is also abundant in human LN medullary sinuses 27, 34. In macrophages, MARCO expression facilitates phagocytic clearance by binding both gram-negative and positive bacteria 48, but its function in LECs is not known. Marco-LECs also express the C-type lectin Clec1b CLEC2 and Figure S4, a ligand for podoplanin PDPN. CLEC2 is also expressed by myeloid cells, including DCs 49, and interaction between PDPN fibroblastic reticular cells FRCs and CLEC2 DCs has been implicated in FRC contractility and LN expansion in inflammation 49, 50. LN LEC-expressed CLEC2 may mediate both homotypic and heterotypic cell interactions, since PDPN is highly expressed by LECs and by surrounding FRCs. Stab2 is highly expressed by Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs Figure S6, and together with Ptx3-LECs they are also enriched for the coagulation factor VIII F8 and Figure S4. We previously showed that LN LECs are a major source of FVIII production 51. The present result shows that F8 along with Stab2 are features of medullary LEC subsets. Their co-expression may be a general feature of sinusoidal EC, since both are also characteristic of hepatic sinusoidal endothelium. FVIII forms a complex with von Willebrand factor vWF in plasma, a complex that is cleared by STAB2-expressing liver sinusoidal blood endothelial cells in a vWF-dependent manner 52. However, the very low expression of vWF by mouse LN LECs 51 and data not shown suggests that FVIII may function as a pro-coagulant factor independent of vWF, possibly promoting the formation of fibrin mesh to block the spread of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus in the medulla 53. The results show that Marco-LECs share gene expression patterns with myeloid cells, suggesting that this LEC subpopulation has a major role in innate immune functions. Interestingly, Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs express higher levels of Kdr, encoding VEGFR2, than other LN subsets and Figure S4, which is discussed in further detail below. Ptx3-LECs: Ptx3 Central Medulla and Paracortical Sinus LECs Marco and Pd-l1 Cd274 Ptx3-LECs uniquely express Pentraxin-3 Ptx3 and. They are also distinguished by expression of Inter-\u03b1-trypsin inhibitor 5 Itih5, Mannose receptor C-type 1 Mrc1, Reelin Reln and a relative enrichment in Lyve1 and Stab2 and Figure S4 and Ccl21a, in C57BL6 mice. PTX3 belongs to the pentraxin family: secreted proteins with a cyclic and multimeric structure 54. They bind pathogens and damaged self-proteins, acting as soluble pattern recognition molecules that mediate activation of complement and promote phagocytosis 54. Medullary sinuses also support sustained and close interactions with long-lived plasma cells 35 and thus adaptive antibody-based and innate responses are likely to provide complementary defense mechanisms at this site. Ptx3-LECs share gene expression with dermal capillary LECs, with which they share morphologic features. Both have sprout-like blind ends specialized for attracting leukocytes and fluid flow into the lymphatics 4, 55 Figures 2, 3. Ptx3 itself is not expressed by dermal capillary LEC in mouse, but capillary and Ptx3-LECs share Itih5, Mrc1, Ccl21, and Lyve1 5658 and data not shown. CCL21 mediates recruitment of CCR7 dendritic cells DCs and T cells into dermal lymphatic capillaries 58, 59. Although in the peripheral LN Ptx3-LECs analyzed here Ccl21 expression is relatively low compared with levels in candidate collecting vessels in, it is more highly expressed in Ptx3-LEC in mesenteric LN not shown and in the human LN, as discussed below. Thus, CCL21 in Ptx3-LECs may contribute to leukocyte-LEC interactions and egress of CCR7 cells including na\u00efve B and T cells, possibly complementing the known role of sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P in this process 55, 60. Expression of the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 promotes the transmigration of DCs into blind-ended capillary lymphatic vessels 57. MRC-1, a known marker for subsets of macrophages, binds microorganisms and promotes phagocytosis 48. MRC-1 expression in peripheral lymphatic vessels also facilitates interaction with CD44-expressing immune cells 56, and could thus interact with activated CD44high T cells in egress from the LN. Thus, the paracortical and medullary sinus Ptx3-LECs share with peripheral capillary LECs gene programs for LEC-immune cell interactions, and support lymphocyte entry into medullary sinuses and exit from the LN. Ptx3 itself, as well as other genes selective to Ptx3-LECs, have known or proposed roles in the extracellular matrix ECM 54. PTX3 binds collagen and fibrinogen-domain containing proteins, including ECM components, but also other pattern recognition molecules like C1q and ficolins 61; thus, it may amplify innate pathogen recognition mechanisms and contribute to maintenance and repair of the LN medullary environment. The Ptx3-LEC marker Reelin Reln is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. In the periphery, Reelin is associated with the transition of peripheral capillary vessels to collecting vessels and contributes to the cross-talk between collecting vessel and surrounding smooth-muscle cells 62. ITIH5 was originally isolated in a complex with hyaluronan 63 which can stabilize the ECM 64. Notably, Ptx3-LECs also express high levels of the hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1 and ITIH-proteins have been shown to interact with PTX3 65. This provides a possible functional link between LYVE-1, ITIH5, and PTX3 in the Ptx3-LEC niche. Ptx3-LECs are also enriched for the collagen and integrin-binding ECM protein TGFbeta-induced protein Tgfbi and Figure S4, which is induced in LECs by hypoxia 66. Together with high levels of the ECM protein Mmrn1 and Figure S4, these genes support the notion of a highly specialized medullary ECM. Ptx3-LECs show the highest levels of Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 Vegfr3, or Flt4 67 and of its co-receptor Neuropilin 2 Nrp2 68 and Figure S4, suggesting a higher responsiveness to vascular endothelial growth factor C VEGFC 69, 70. VEGFC is a major driver of lymphangiogenesis in development 69 and in the adult lymphatic vasculature 71. VEGFR2 Kdr, which binds both VEGFC and VEGFA 67, is also highly expressed in Ptx3-LECs, although it is most enriched in Marco-LECs. Thus, VEGFA and VEGFC may elicit niche-specific responses in medullary sinus LECs, acting differently on Vegfr3high Vegfr2intermed Ptx3-LECs and Vegfr3intermedlow Vegfr2high Marco-LECs. Interestingly, while SCS fLEC and cLECs are established in embryogenesis 36, the medullary sinuses form by sprouting during the first two postnatal weeks 72. Thus, high Vegfr3 Flt4 in Ptx3-LEC could reflect retention of their postnatal programs for VEGFC-dependent sprouting 72, and may imbue them with the capacity to regenerate or expand rapidly in response to the requirements of LN inflammatory responses. It is well-established that it is primarily the LYVE-1 medullary and paracortical sinuses that expand in response to inflammation and in tumor draining LNs 73, 74. The Ptx3-LEC marker Angiopoietin 2 Angpt2 has also been linked to LEC proliferation 75, 76: it can induce lymphatic hyperplasia when overexpressed 76 and is highly expressed by newly formed lymphatic vessels in inflammation-induced lymphangiogenesis 75. Ptx3-LECs, like cLECs, but in contrast to all other parenchymal LN LEC subsets, also lack expression of PD-L1 Cd274. Loss of PD-L1 is associated with increased LN LEC proliferation but also increased LEC apoptosis after inflammation 25. Thus, low PD-L1 suggest higher responsiveness not only to proliferation-inducing signals but also higher sensitivity to apoptotic cell death, the latter thought to facilitate LN contraction after inflammatory stimuli 25. Taken together, high Vegfr3, Vegfr2, Nrp2, Angpt2, and low Cd274 PD-L1 suggest a major role of Ptx3-LECs in LN remodeling. A Cellular Bridge Between the SCS Ceiling and Floor As discussed earlier, trajectory analysis not only predicts a transitional population, tzLECs, that link fLEC and Marco-LEC, but further identifies a bridge population that connects cLEC and fLEC. This bridge population is variably represented in the mouse samples and Figure S1A but is prominent in the human see below,. We plotted gene expression of cells along the path from cLEC to fLEC Figure S5 and Figure S7A and found that individual cells within the bridge display variable levels of cLEC and fLEC marker transcripts including Lyve1 Figure S7A, but overall a decreasing gradient of cLEC markers e.g., Ackr4 and Cav1 and an increasing gradient of fLEC markers Madcam1, Pd-l1Cd274 in the progression from cLEC to fLEC Figure S7A. We speculate that these cells participate in formation of previously described transendothelial channels, physical bridges that link the subcapsular ceiling and floor 10, 12, 36. Immunofluorescence imaging indicate that these cords consist not only of channels 10, 36, but also nucleated LECs traversing the sinus, as indicated by nuclear staining for the lymphatic reporter Prox1-GFP Figure S7B. We used immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization for RNA RNAscope to evaluate bridge cell expression of cLEC and fLEC markers Figure S7 and Figure S5. Most bridging cells displayed defining phenotypes of cLEC LYVE-1, PD-L1, MAdCAM-1 or fLEC LYVE-1, PD-L1, MAdCAM-1 on the protein level. Cells co-expressing these cLEC and fLEC markers as predicted for cells of the computationally defined bridge were rare or absent Figure S7. However, RNAscope revealed that bridging cells lack mRNA for Bmp4 cLEC marker and have intermediate expression of Bmp2 fLEC marker, a pattern consistent with the single cell profiles of the predicted bridge Figure S5. Although this observation provides some support for the correspondence between the physical and trajectory-inferred cellular bridges, they are far from being conclusive. An alternative possibility is that fLEC and cLEC can interconvert in response to local environmental signals, and that the transcription profiles of these bridge cells are snapshots of cells in process of these transitions. Further experiments are required to map the computationally defined bridge cells within the LN lymphatic network and to confidently identify the profiles of the in situ cellular links between SCS floor and ceiling. Niche-Specific Inflammatory Responses in LN LECs Oxazolone Oxa is a chemical compound used in a prototypical model for inflammation-induced LN hypertrophy 73. We here chose to look at initial LEC responses 48 h after topical skin application of Oxa, before any major lymphangiogenic responses are expected. Lymphangiogenesis is a late effect in LN remodeling, peaking at 57 days after Oxa, or other inflammatory stimuli 25, 73, 77. We aligned LEC of the Oxa-treated mouse with the untreated control of the same genetic background and observed two new subsets, termed Ox1 and Ox2, in the immunized group.. Niche-specific inflammatory responses in LN LECs. A tUMAP UMAP on trajectory distances of LEC from Oxa-treated and control mice, colored by subsets, including the two additional subsets Ox1 and Ox2 in the Oxa-treated group left. tPC principal components on trajectory distances of LEC from Oxa-treated and control mice, highlighting Ox1 red and Ox2 blue respectively right. B Pairwise Pearson correlation of LEC subsets in Oxa-treated group, calculated using the subset mean expression of the top 1,000 variable genes. C Venn diagrams of DEGs from Ox1 in Oxa-treated LNs compared with fLEC in control LNs, and from Ox2 in Oxa-treated LNs compared with Ptx3-LEC in control LNs upper; p  0.01, fold change  1.2. Heatmaps of 50 select upregulated or downregulated DEGs, with ribosomal genes excluded from the downregulated panel lower; row scaled. D Select GO terms and BioPlanet pathways from Enrichr analysis of DEGs. Inspection of the tSpace projections tUMAP UMAP on trajectory distances and tPC principal components of trajectory distances suggests that Ox1 arises from fLECs, and Ox2 from Ptx3-LECs. Pairwise Pearson correlation based on the top 1,000 variable genes confirmed that Ox1 is most correlated with fLECs Pearson correlation coefficient  0.97 and Ox2 with Ptx3-LECs Pearson correlation coefficient  0.92. We asked which genes were differentially expressed in Ox1 and Ox2 due to Oxa treatment. Compared to fLEC and Ptx3-LEC in untreated LN, respectively, we found that both Ox1 and Ox2 displayed typical interferon IFN responses, with dramatic induction of Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 as well as Irf7, the master regulator of type-I IFN-dependent immune responses 78. CXCL9 and CXCL10 bind CXCR3, which mediates recruitment of dendritic cells, NK cells, effector T-cells 79 and, in inflamed LNs, subsets of monocytes 80. Both Ox1 and Ox2 also showed upregulated Psme2, a proteosomal component involved in peptide processing for class I antigen presentation 81. While most gene changes were shared, some were preferentially or more dramatically increased in one or the other subset. Ccl20, which is selectively expressed by fLEC in resting LNs, is highly upregulated in Ox1 but not Ox2, maintaining its selective pattern of expression in the SCS floor Figures 1D, 5B, 6C. Ox1 also displays selective upregulation of Ubiquitin D Ubd, important in activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B 82. Oxa controls subset-specific upregulation of monocyte chemoattractants Ccl2 Ox2 and Ccl5 Ox1. CCL5 acts through CCR5, which is expressed by multiple adaptive and innate immune subsets; while CCL2 acts through CCR2 in monocyte recruitment 43. Thus, chemotactic regulations in the SCS and medulla diverge. Gene enrichment analysis confirms Ox1 and Ox2 share enrichment in interferon signaling and immune system signatures, but the subsets also display unique ontologies: e.g., Transforming Growth Factor TGF-beta regulation of ECM in Ox1 and response to Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF in Ox2. Several of the observed changes, including induction of Ccl2, Ccl5, Ccl20, Cxcl9, and Cxcl10 were observed previously in analyses of bulk LN LECs in response to HSV-1 virus 77 or after ovalbumin specific T-cell responses 11. Our results link inflammation-induced transcriptional changes to specific LEC subsets, implying that niche-specific changes coordinate LEC-driven responses in early inflammation. Interestingly, in both Ox1 and Ox2, significantly more genes are downregulated than upregulated. Pathway analysis shows downregulation of genes associated with viral gene expression, ribosomes and mRNA processing. This may be a result of the activation of type I interferon signaling, which can cause widespread downregulation of host and viral transcriptional and translational pathways as a defense against viral replication 83, 84. Downregulated genes include Csf1 and Ltb, which is interesting from the perspective of the known transient loss of sinusoidal LN macrophages in acute inflammation 18, 19. Core lymphatic endothelial differentiation genes are also downregulated, including Lyve1 and Cldn5, and subset marker genes are inhibited as well. Ox1 shows reduced expression of fLEC marker genes Cd74 and Bmp2, and Ox2 of Ptx3-LEC marker genes including Stab2 and Tgfbi. In addition to IFN-induced transcriptional repression, another contributing factor may be transcription factor availability, which can dictate level of gene expression 85: TNF-induced RELA-dependent pathways, which are also induced as part of the Oxa response, have been shown to redirect cofactors from super-enhancers, repressing cell identity genes in a cell type dependent manner 86. LEC Phenotypes in Human and Mouse LNs Common Mouse and Human LN LEC Phenotypes We have previously reported LEC diversity and described multiple LEC subsets in human LNs 27. Here we compare our mouse LEC samples to a representative sample of human head and neck LN LECs, selected for its quality, high cell number, and inclusion of each of the subsets we identified. We translated human gene names to their mouse homologs, and integrated human and mouse LECs using Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA 87, which implements a variant of the mutual nearest neighbor algorithm MNN 88. Cross mapping successfully aligned human and mouse LECs, and unsupervised clustering of the aligned cells identified shared but also unique subsets in human LN. The five subsets common to mouse and human cLEC, fLEC, Ptx3-LEC, valve-LEC, and Marco-LEC display high correspondence with human LEC subsets defined previously using unsupervised clustering 27 LEC I, II, IV, V, and VI, respectively. Specifically, the Marco-LEC subset of medullary EC maps to human LEC VI, which we previously characterized as medullary sinus CD209 LECs 27. However, mouse Ptx3-LECs map to human LEC IV, which we postulated to be peripheral capillary LECs 27. We discuss this below.. Cross-mapping of mouse and human LNs reveals conserved LEC populations and additional human cLEC subsets. A UMAP of aligned mouse and human LEC, colored by integrated mouse and human LEC subset left and middle, or human LEC ID as in 27 right. Bridge cells are not shown. B Pairwise overlap scores of top 100 subset-specific DEGs for mouse and human LEC. Overlap score is defined as the ratio between the number of shared genes observed and the number of genes expected to be shared by chance. C Correlation of gene profiles of human LEC subsets. Color scale: pairwise Pearson correlation coefficient, calculated using the mean expression of the top 1000 variable genes left. Expression of cLEC subset-specific genes, projected on UMAP plot of human LN LECs right. D Select pathways from Enrichr analysis of DEGs common to mouse and human. Specialization of the Human SCS Ceiling Unsupervised clustering aligned the mouse cLECs with one subset of the human cLECs, core cLECs, which we identified previously as LEC I 27, but additional cLEC subsets cLEC s1, s2, and s3 were unique to the analyzed human LN. Pearson correlation analysis reveals similarity of these subsets with the core cLECs. cLEC s3 is most similar to the core cLEC population as indicated by correlation and hierarchical clustering, UMAP, and differentially expressed genes DEGs data not shown: we do not discuss this subset further. cLEC s1 corresponds to MFAP4 SCS LEC LEC III, which we located overlying the human LN medulla 27. Consistent with this, cLEC s1 clusters close to Ptx3-LECs, and links other cLECs to Ptx3-LECs in trajectory space see below. cLEC s2, which we did not segregate previously, uniquely expresses high levels of Hairyenhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein HEY1, the chemokine CCL2, and E-Selectin SELE data not shown, suggestive of an activated state. Both E-selectin and CCL2 are induced by inflammation in endothelial cells and regulate leukocyte recruitment 89. Based on HEY1 and SELE expression, the subset is identifiable in 3 of the 6 human LN samples we studied previously 27 data not shown. The findings suggest greater heterogeneity and specialization in SCS ceiling LEC in humans than in the resting specific-pathogen-free SPF mice studied here. The subset specialization of human cLEC may relate to local differences in immune environments, or to the more complex architecture of the human LN. Unlike the mouse, human cLECs participate in invaginations of the capsule, known as trabecular sinuses 4, which may experience more turbulent flow of the incoming lymph and hence variation in shear stress. Comparisons of Human and Mouse LEC Differentially Expressed Genes DEG To evaluate similarities between species, we compared DEGs of mouse and human LEC subsets using a gene overlap score, defined as the ratio of the number of shared DEGs to the number of genes expected to be shared based on random chance, for each combination of mouse and human subsets. In all instances, the highest overlap scores are seen between corresponding subsets. Based on overlap scores, cLECs are more conserved than the more immunologically active subsets fLECs, Marco-LECs, and Ptx3-LECs. The floor and medullary sinus subsets showed less conserved DEG profiles, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure in response to pathogens, contrasting with conservation of structural functions of cLECs. Gene set enrichment analysis based on conserved genes has the potential to highlight core functions of the LEC subsets. Shared cLEC genes are involved in focal adhesion, fluid shear stress response and ECM interaction, consistent with their structural role and association to the capsule. Ptx3-LECs are enriched in genes for endocytosis and lysosome, which could relate to the high expression of scavenger receptors e.g., Lyve1, Stab1, Stab2. Marco-LECs are enriched for lysosomal genes, and for genes of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway as well as the coagulation and complement cascades. fLECs display high enrichment for inflammatory pathways, including JAK-STAT and Nuclear Factor NF-kappa B, and are enriched for genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, supporting their immunomodulatory properties. A number of mouse key subset specific marker DEGs are shared in the human, including fLECs: Bmp2, Ccl20, Cd74, and Csf1; cLECs: Ackr4, Bmp4, and Cav1; Marco-LECs: Marco, Clec4g, and C2; and Ptx3-LECs: Ptx3, Nrp2, and Flt4 Vegfr3. We illustrate expression of these and other select shared marker genes in.. Conserved gene programs for mouse and human LEC specialization. Expression of select gene homologs or paralogs Itih5 and ITIH3 in cLECs, fLECs, Ptx3-LECs, Marco-LECs and valve LECs. Color indicates subset mean log transcript count, normalized within each subset. Dot size indicates subset mean log transcript count, scaled to the maximum value for each gene. As noted above, mouse Marco-LECs align with LEC VI, which we identified previously as the major medullary sinus subset in human LNs 27. Unexpectedly, mouse Ptx3-LECs align with a subset LEC IV that we previously related to capillary LECs based on their enrichment for expression of Ccl21 and Lyve1 27, gene markers of peripheral capillary lymphatic vessels 57, 58. However, these genes are also expressed by mouse Ptx3-LECs Figures 1D, 5B, 8, and as noted earlier, their expression likely reflects the parallels with capillary LEC in morphology blind ends, loose EC junctions and function recruiting fluid and lymphocytes into lymph 4. Supporting a medullary identity, Ptx3-LECs and LEC IV share high levels the sinusoidal endothelial marker Stab2STAB2 46, shown to be expressed by medullary sinuses in human LNs 90. Importantly, human Ptx3-LECs LEC IV also share expression of PTX3 and lack PD-L1 CD274 expression, similar to their mouse counterpart; and they express the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor gene family member ITIH3, functionally related to the mouse Ptx3-LEC marker Itih5 64. Ptx3-LECs in both humans and mice are distinguished from Marco-LECs by higher expression of the glycoprotein and scavenger receptor CD36, also known as Fatty Acid Translocase FAT. Staining of CD36 in human head and neck LNs identified capillary-like, CD36high LYVE-1 lymphatic cords, negative for MARCO and the Marco-LEC LEC VI 27 marker CLEC4M Figures 9B,C. These CD36high lymphatic sinuses were found either as isolated cords in the paracortex Figures 9B,C or as extended sprouts from MARCO CLEC4M medullary sinuses, similar to mouse Ptx3-LECs which connects to Marco-LECs in perifollicular regions. Human Ptx3-LECs are also distinguished from Marco-LECs by high expression of PDPN and CCL21, as predicted by the transcriptional profiles Figure S8, while both medullary subsets express LYVE-1 and STAB2 Figure S8. Thus, cross-species comparison of single-cell profiles and in situ analysis support that human and mouse share two distinct niches of paracortical and medullary sinus LECs: MARCO LECs, which correspond to the previously published CD209 medullary sinus LEC subset LEC VI 27, and Ptx3-LECs, PDPNhigh, CD36high paracortical and medullary sinus LECs, corresponding to LEC IV 27 in our earlier classification of human LN LECs. Notably, human and mouse LN LECs also share the in situ physical transition between Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs, as predicted in trajectory analysis Figures 1C, 10A, discussed below..

B Expression pattern of indicated genes. Marco-LEC, Ptx3-LEC, and cLEC s1 populations are highlighted. Values are batch-corrected imputed log counts. Species-Specific Gene Expression A number of genes with homologs in mouse and human are not conserved in expression, or display different patterns of subset selectivity. Here we highlight select examples for discussion Figure S9. As noted earlier, the mouse fLEC markers Madcam1 and Msr1 are poorly expressed by human LECs 27 data not shown. ACKR1, also known as DARC Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines, marks human fLECs and Marco-LECs, but Ackr1 has very low expression in mouse LN LECs, without clear subset selectivity Figure S9B. Consistent with this, endothelial ACKR1 in mouse is restricted to venular blood vessels, with only sparse and low detection in LECs 91. ACKR1 is a chemokine interceptor, which can serve as a sink for a large range of inflammatory chemokines 92. Its expression could reflect a greater need to moderate inflammatory chemokines in the human. Alternatively, it may facilitate transport of chemokines across the lymphatic endothelium in the human LN, as ACKR1 has been shown to shuttle chemokines across endothelial cell layers 93. Several ACKR1 ligands are expressed by human fLECs including CXCL3 and CXCL5 27. Human but not mouse LN LECs also display high expression of IL6 in fLECs Figure S9B, likely reflecting a higher inflammatory basal state in human, especially compared to our SPF mice. Human Ptx3-LECs express MMP2 and LOX, genes missing in mouse LECs or expressed in different subsets i.e., Lox expressed weakly in cLECs in mouse Figure S9B. Both Matrix metalloproteinase 2 MMP2 and Lysyl oxidase LOX can contribute to ECM modulation 94, 95, suggesting that, although matrix interplay is conserved, the specific mechanisms of matrix interaction in this population of LECs may have diverged. Mouse-specific LN LEC DEGs include Apolipoprotein E ApoE in cLECs and medullary sinus populations and Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 Rgs4 in fLECs Figure S9B. Carboxypeptidase E Cpe and Carbonic anhydrase 8 Car8 are examples of genes with different expression pattern across mouse and mouse LN LEC subsets Figure S9B. Since scRNA-seq is often unable to detect low abundance transcripts, the apparent lack of expression of a gene must be interpreted with caution: the expression pattern of the genes mentioned here have been observed in each of our samples. In addition, CD209 and CLEC4M, which lack orthologs in mouse 27, are specific for human Marco-LECs. We described them previously as medullary sinus markers 27. Human IL32 and mouse Glycam1 also lack orthologs. IL-32 potently amplifies inflammatory responses by induction of multiple cytokines 96; it is highly expressed by human Ptx3-LECs data not shown. GLYCAM1, a secreted mucin that on high endothelial venules is decorated with glycotopes for leukocyte selectins 97, is selectively expressed by mouse fLEC and Figure S4. The Continuum of Human LEC Phenotypes in Trajectory Space We have focused to this point on comparing subsets of human and mouse LECs, but as illustrated for the mouse, LECs exist in a phenotypic continuum that may reflect physical alignments spatial transitions, developmental sequences, or both. To gain further insight into LEC diversity and zonation within human LNs, we ran tSpace on combined LN LECs from our six previously published human samples 27. In the tSpace projections in, cell identities are determined based on correlation with the core subsets in our index human LN left or based on unsupervised clustering as previously 27 right. Alignment of human LECs in trajectory space reveals both similarities and differences to the mouse. Shared subsets are aligned in the same order as in the mouse, with links from Valve-LECs to cLECs, Ptx3-LECs, Marco-LECs and finally fLECs compare with mouse alignments in Figures 1B,C. However, in the human, the cellular bridge between cLECs and fLECs is highly populated with cells. The human-specific cLEC subsets also show interesting alignments. cLEC s2 appears closely linked to the bridge. cLEC s1, which we previously identified as SCS ceiling LEC overlying the medulla LEC III 27, extends toward and links prominently to Ptx3-LECs see arrows: Cells from both subsets within this Ptx3-LECs-to-cLEC s1 trajectory express PTX3 itself, and are highly enriched in CCL21, suggesting a relationship of PTX3 medullary sinuses and the perihilar ceiling. Supporting this notion, RNAscope of a neonatal human LN showed extensive PTX3 in the medulla of the hilar region data not shown. Co-expression of CCL21 and SPHK1 enzyme required for S1P production support a role of Ptx3-LECs in lymphocyte egress. Heterogeneity in ANGPT2 also exists along the Ptx3-LEC paths. The alignments outlined here are not an artifact of the high cell number or integration of LEC from different LNs, because the same patterns and linkages are seen in independent tSpace projections of our index LN sample not shown. Human LN LECs thus display numerous intermediate phenotypes and complex zonation that may reflect the complexity of human LN architecture observed histologically. Summary and Outlook The LN lymphatic vasculature provides a complex lymphatic vascular bed, adapted to a unique microenvironment where cooperation between stromal cells and immune cells forms the basis for effective immune cell interaction and activation. Endothelial cells in this environment not only need to provide a framework for the structural organization of the organ, but also need to be able to adapt to constant changes induced by immunological stimuli and organ expansion in LN hypertrophy, and to support tolerogenic immune reactions in homeostasis. We define five LN LEC subsets in mouse: valve LECs, the SCS Ackr4 cLECs, the immune active Ccl20 fLECs, as well as Ptx3-LECs and Marco-LECs, two paracortical and medullary sinus subsets that were not recognized previously. Single-cell gene profiles indicate niche-specific functional specialization of these subsets with distinct pathways for pathogen interactions and matrix modeling. Interestingly, cross-species mapping with human LN LECs shows that both subsets as well as their respective functions are conserved, which allows us to redefine the subset previously identified as candidate capillary LECs LEC IV 27 in human LN to paracortical sinus Ptx3-LECs. PTX3 and MARCO, gene markers chosen here to designate the two distinct medullary LEC subsets, are conserved both in their expression patterns among LEC subsets and also in protein sequence between humans and mice 92 homology PTX3 and 69 MARCO, suggesting that they may have conserved functions as well. Recently developed algorithms have made important advances in solving the complex problem of integrating different datasets 8799. As shown here, they not only perform well in combining sample replicates by removing batch effects, but can also identify and map similar subsets of cells across species barriers. Mutual nearest neighbors and CCA algorithms not only mapped human LEC subsets to mouse counterparts, but also uncovered species-specific LN LEC subset compositions, revealing a greater diversity of SCS ceiling LEC in human. We can look forward to continuing advances in computational approaches to integrating and mining scRNA-seq data. Particularly exciting is the power of trajectory inference to recapitulate or predict the organization of endothelial cells within the complex vascular networks. While trajectory analysis has been shown to model sequences of cell phenotypes in development pseudotime 30, our results both in lymphatics here and blood vascular EC studies 31 show that computed alignments of cells in trajectory space reflect the tissue architecture spatial organization and physical relationships between endothelial cells in situ with surprising faithfulness. This correspondence implies, as an approximation, that endothelial cell phenotypes progress in a gradual and orderly fashion within the linear arrangements as in vascular tubes or sheets as in the SCS and sinus-lining LECs in the LN that make up the endothelium. In essence, trajectories provide a computational roadmap for mapping gene expression to the vascular endothelium. The results underscore the diversity of endothelial cells as a continuum, punctuated by concentrations of particular phenotypes or niches that are identified as subsets. Whether the progression of phenotypes and zonation among LN LECs reflects malleable LEC responses to local niche factors, retention of a programmed developmental response, or both, remains to be determined. Our studies here demonstrate the power of single-cell profiling to illuminate the biology of the vascular endothelium, and the promise it holds to revolutionize our understanding of conserved and species-specific regulation of the vasculature and its responses in physiology and human disease. Materials and Methods Mice Male and female 68-week-old BALBcJ or 812-week-old C57BL6J peripheral LNs inguinal, axillary and brachial processed by 10x Genomics workflow, or 20-week-old Prox1-GFPC57BL6J 33 female inguinal LNs processed by SMART-seq2 workflow were used for scRNA-seq. Mice were bred and maintained in the animal facilities at Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal. In addition, mice were held at a Specific Pathogen Free SPF facility Uppsala University, and experimental procedures were approved by the local animal ethics committee at the Uppsala County Court 600917. Immune Challenge BALBcJ mice were subjected to cutaneous Oxazolone Oxa challenge by applying 5 4-Ethoxymethylene-2-phenyl-2-oxazolin-5-one Sigma-Aldrich in acetone and olive oil topical to the skin as described 73. Axillary, brachial, and inguinal draining LNs were harvested 48 h after immunization. Tissue Dissociation and Single-Cell Library Preparation Cell isolation for 10x: Single-cell suspensions of total EC were generated as previously described 100. For each group, axillary, inguinal, and brachial LNs from 25 to 30 male and female BALBcJ or C57BL6J mice were combined, minced, washed with Hanks Balanced Salt solution, and dissociated for 30 min at 37C with gentle rocking in HBSS with calcium and magnesium medium containing 0.2 mgml Collagenase P, 0.8 mgml Dispase II, and 0.01 mgml DNase I Sigma-Aldrich adapted from 14. Hematopoietic cells were depleted with anti-CD45 mouse MicroBeads according to the manufacturers protocol Miltenyi and the remaining cells were stained with anti-CD31 BV605 clone 390 and anti-PDPN PE-Cy7 clone 8.1.1 antibodies, as well as dump antibodies consisting of anti-CD45 clone 30-F11, anti-EpCAM clone G8.8, anti-TER119 clone TER-119, anti-CD11a clone H155-78, and anti-CD11b clone M170 in PerCP-Cy5.5. Total EC lin CD31 were sorted into 100 fetal bovine serum using FACS Aria III BD Biosciences; 100 um nozzle; 2,500 cellss, washed, and immediately processed to generate scRNA-seq library using Chromium Single Cell 3 Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 10x Genomics according to manufacturers instructions. Libraries were sequenced with NextSeq 500 Illumina using 150 cycles high output V2 kit Read 1: 26 bp, Read 2: 98 bp at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility. Cell isolation for SMART-seq2: Inguinal LN digests from Prox1-GFP mice 33, depleted for hematopoietic cells as described above, were stained with anti-CD31 PE-Cy7 clone 390, anti-PDPN AF660 clone eBio8.11 antibodies Thermo Fisher Scientific. Dump channel included anti-mouse TER-119 eFluor450 clone Ter119, anti-mouse CD45 eFluor450 clone 30-F11, anti-mouse CD11b eFluor450 clone M170, and dead cell staining SYTOX Blue Thermo Fisher Scientific. Triple positive live cells GFP PDPN CD31 LECs were gated and sorted on a BD FACSAria III BD Biosciences 100 um nozzle, 20 psi as single cells into a 384 well plate with lysis buffer. Single cell libraries were prepared as described and sequenced on a HiSeq2500 101. Single-Cell RNA-seq Data Analysis 10x Genomics: Read alignment and quality control were performed using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v3.0.2 and the mm10 reference genome. Loupe Cell Browser v3.1.1; 10x Genomics was used to manually gate on LEC Pdpn CD31 for downstream analysis. SMART-seq2: After lane demultiplexing, SMART-seq2 based FASTQ files were trimmed with Trim Galore v0.4.4 followed by alignment of the data to the mouse reference genome mm10-GRCm38 using TopHat v2.1.1 and bowtie2 v2.2.6.0. PCR duplicates were removed using SAMtools v0.1.18. Counting of fragments aligning per gene was done using the featurecounts function of the Subread package v1.4.6-p5. Count data were processed with the Seurat package v3.1.0 87, 99. For quality control, genes that were expressed in fewer than three cells and cells that expressed fewer than 100 genes were excluded from analysis. Raw counts were log normalized, and 2000 most variable genes were identified based on a variance stabilizing transformation. To correct for batch differences, variable gene sets were used to align multiple datasets for joint analysis, using the Canonical Correlation Analysis CCA method within the FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions of the Seurat package, which implements a variant of the mutual nearest neighbors MNN algorithm. Correspondences between single cells across datasets were identified and multiple datasets were transformed into a shared space. Principal Component Analysis PCA dimensionality reduction was performed using the variable gene sets. Cell clusters were determined using a Shared Nearest Neighbor SNN modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm of the Seurat FindClusters function, and were visualized with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding tSNE 102 or Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection UMAP 103. Contaminating pericyte, immune and blood endothelial cells were removed by supervised gating on the tSNE plot. To recover gene-gene relationships that are lost due to dropouts, we imputed missing gene expression data from log normalized count data using an in-house customization https:github.comkbruloismagicBatch of the MAGIC Markov Affinity-based Graph Imputation of Cells algorithm with optimized parameters t  2, k  9, ka  3 104. Imputed data were used for visualization of single-cell gene expression in violin plots and heatmaps 105, as well as for trajectory analyses. Nearest Neighbor Alignments in Trajectory Space tSpace was used to model the nearest neighbor relationships as well as transitional zones between LEC subsets 30. Mapping of cells in trajectory space allows unsupervised reconstruction and exploration of complex developmental sequences, without implementation of cell clustering or manifold distortion for graphical expedience. Batch effects were removed using the fastMNN function of the batchelor package v1.0.1 88 and variable genes were identified using the scran package 106. For mouse LEC, we used tSpace with default parameters T  100, K  20, 5 graphs, 20 way points, Euclidean distance metric and imputed expression values of the top 800 variable genes Figures 1C, 6A, right panel or batch-corrected low-dimensional coordinates top 50 coordinates, left panel. The trajectory matrices were visualized in low dimensional space using PCA Figures 1C, 6A, right panel or UMAP, left panel within the tSpace package. For combined human LEC samples, imputed data of LEC from 6 LNs were batch-corrected as above. Twenty PCs from the 1000 variable genes were calculated, the loadings were adjusted to a minimum value of 0 by addition of a constant and used as input to the tSpace algorithm T  200, K  25, 5 graphs, 10-way points, cosine distance metric. Differential Gene Expression and Gene Enrichment Analysis Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the negative binomial generalized linear model within the FindMarkers function of Seurat on log normalized count data p  0.01, fold change  1.2. To identify subset-defining genes, single-cell transcriptomes of cells in the subset of interest were compared to those of all other cells within the same sample. Only upregulated DEGs were considered, unless otherwise specified. Gene enrichment analysis of DEGs with Gene Ontology 107, 108, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 109, 110, and BioPlanet 111 databases was performed using Enrichr 112, 113. Correlation Analysis To determine similarities between LEC subsets, mean gene expression values were calculated for each subset. The top 1000 most variable genes across all subsets were used for pairwise Pearson correlation analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the average linkage method. Cross Species Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Human HNLN1 dataset GSE124494 27 was used for the integrated LEC profiling. Human gene names were converted to their mouse homologs using the biomaRt package v2.40.4 114. scRNA-seq datasets were integrated in Seurat for unsupervised clustering. The top 100 most upregulated DEGs for each subset, as ranked by the fold change of gene expression in the subset relative to other LEC combined, were determined for human LEC and separately for mouse. An overlap score was defined as the number of DEGs common to one human subset and one mouse subset divided by the number of genes expected to be shared by the two subsets by chance. For each pair of mouse subset and human subsets, overlap score  n  A  B  N, where n  number of observed overlapping genes between the top 100 DEGs of the human subset and the mouse subset, A  number of DEGs considered in the mouse subset 100, B  number of DEGs considered in the human subset with mouse homologs, and N  total number of genes detected in both mouse and human LEC, 13,458. Reanalysis of Human LEC Datasets For the combined analysis of human LEC samples 27, imputed gene expression data were batch-corrected and used for trajectory analysis as above. LEC in each of the additional five human samples were classified by correspondence to the index human subsets that mapped with mouse subsets as follows: reference subset mean gene expression was generated from the index HNLN1 human dataset, using core cells of each major subset that cross-mapped with mouse subsets, as well as manually gated bridge cells that link fLEC and cLEC in tSpace projections. Cells in the other human samples were classified by Pearson correlation using the 1000 most variable genes in the reference set. Immunostaining of Mouse LNs Inguinal and popliteal mouse LNs were harvested from Prox1-GFP mice 33 and fixed in 0.8 paraformaldehyde PFA for 12 h at 4C.

Single-cell transcriptomics promise to revolutionize our understanding of the vasculature. Emerging computational methods applied to high-dimensional single-cell data allow integration of results between samples and species and illuminate the diversity and underlying developmental and architectural organization of cell populations. Here, we illustrate these methods in the analysis of mouse lymph node LN lymphatic endothelial cells LEC at single-cell resolution. Clustering identifies five well-delineated subsets, including two medullary sinus subsets not previously recognized as distinct. Nearest neighbor alignments in trajectory space position the major subsets in a sequence that recapitulates the known features and suggests novel features of LN lymphatic organization, providing a transcriptional map of the lymphatic endothelial niches and of the transitions between them. Differences in gene expression reveal specialized programs for 1 subcapsular ceiling endothelial interactions with the capsule connective tissue and cells; 2 subcapsular floor regulation of lymph borne cell entry into the LN parenchyma and antigen presentation; and 3 pathogen interactions and 4 LN remodeling in distinct medullary subsets. LEC of the subcapsular sinus floor and medulla, which represent major sites of cell entry and exit from the LN parenchyma respectively, respond robustly to oxazolone inflammation challenge with enriched signaling pathways that converge on both innate and adaptive immune responses. Integration of mouse and human single-cell profiles reveals a conserved cross-species pattern of lymphatic vascular niches and gene expression, as well as specialized human subsets and genes unique to each species. The examples provided demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis in elucidating endothelial cell heterogeneity, vascular organization, and endothelial cell responses. We discuss the findings from the perspective of LEC functions in relation to niche formations in the unique stromal and highly immunological environment of the LN. ORIGINAL RESEARCH article Front.

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression.

Here, we use single cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to define the heterogeneity of human T cells isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow and blood, and their functional responses following stimulation. Through analysis of 50,000 resting and activated T cells, we reveal tissue T cell signatures in mucosal and lymphoid sites, and lineage-specific activation states across all sites including distinct effector states for CD8 T cells and an interferon-response state for CD4 T cells. Comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor-associated T cells to our dataset reveals predominant activated CD8 compared to CD4 T cell states within multiple tumor types. Our results therefore establish a high dimensional reference map of human T cell activation in health for analyzing T cells in disease. scRNA-seq analysis of human T cells in blood and tissues We obtained BM, LN, and LG as representative primary lymphoid, secondary lymphoid and mucosal tissue sites, respectively, from two deceased adult organ donors who met the criteria of health for donation of physiologically healthy tissues for lifesaving transplantation, being free of chronic disease and cancer Supplementary Table 1. Human T cells persist in distinct anatomic sites, maintain protective immunity and surveillance, and are key targets for immune modulation in tumor immunotherapy, transplantation, and autoimmunity.\nDataset: Cell Type: immature alpha-beta T cell, Tissue: lower lobe of left lung, Gene Expression: TMSB4X RPS27 B2M RPL41 RPLP1 RPL10 EEF1A1 RPL13 RPS19 RPL13A RPL34 RPS29 RPLP2 RPL21

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate follicular growth and regression, ensuring ovarian tissue homeostasis, remain elusive. We have performed single-cell RNA-sequencing using human adult ovaries to provide a map of the molecular signature of growing and regressing follicular populations. We have identified different types of granulosa and theca cells and detected local production of components of the complement system by atretic theca cells and stromal cells. We also have detected a mixture of adaptive and innate immune cells, as well as several types of endothelial and smooth muscle cells to aid the remodeling process. Our results highlight the relevance of mapping whole adult organs at the single-cell level and reflect ongoing efforts to map the human body. The association between complement system and follicular remodeling may provide key insights in reproductive biology and infertility. Sample preparation from the inner cortex of adult ovary We have analyzed anonymised ovarian tissue inner cortex from adult women N  5 undergoing fertility preservation procedures outer cortex is cryopreserved. Several studies have used single-cell technology to reveal the molecular signatures of fetal24,25 and adult oocytes26,27,28,29,30,31 during human oogenesis.\nDataset: Cell Type: B cell, Tissue: ovary,

Despite extensive research, disease heterogeneity is poorly characterized, hampering efforts for early diagnosis and improved treatments. Here, we apply single cell RNA sequencing to study the heterogeneity of 40 individuals along the multiple myeloma progression spectrum, including 11 healthy controls, demonstrating high interindividual variability that can be explained by expression of known multiple myeloma drivers and additional putative factors. We identify extensive subclonal structures for 10 of 29 individuals with multiple myeloma. In asymptomatic individuals with early disease and in those with minimal residual disease post-treatment, we detect rare tumor plasma cells with molecular characteristics similar to those of active myeloma, with possible implications for personalized therapies. Single cell analysis of rare circulating tumor cells allows for accurate liquid biopsy and detection of malignant plasma cells, which reflect bone marrow disease. Our work establishes single cell RNA sequencing for dissecting blood malignancies and devising detailed molecular characterization of tumor cells in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Individuals with multiple myeloma display unique signatures that converge into common malignant pathways To better understand the heterogeneity within and across individuals with multiple myeloma, we designed a protocol for single cell transcriptomic characterization of the bone marrow plasma cells as well as the circulating plasma cells from individuals with MGUS, SMM, multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. We report on a new methodology for sensitive characterization of the entire spectrum of clinical progression from normal plasma cells to multiple myeloma using scRNA-seq.\nDataset: Cell Type: T cell,

However, little is known about the cells that make up the human liver and its immune microenvironment. Here we report a map of the cellular landscape of the human liver using single-cell RNA sequencing. We provide the transcriptional profiles of 8444 parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells obtained from the fractionation of fresh hepatic tissue from five human livers. Using gene expression patterns, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical examinations, we identify 20 discrete cell populations of hepatocytes, endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, B cells, conventional and non-conventional T cells, NK-like cells, and distinct intrahepatic monocytemacrophage populations. Together, our study presents a comprehensive view of the human liver at single-cell resolution that outlines the characteristics of resident cells in the liver, and in particular provides a map of the human hepatic immune microenvironment. A protocol for human liver dissociation for scRNA-seq A central problem in liver tissue dissociation is that hepatocytes and cholangiocytes are sensitive to cell death, and other cells activate, in response to cell manipulation15,16,17. A key problem hindering the study of the human liver is difficulty in accessing fresh tissue.\nDataset: Cell Type: B cell, Tissue: liver, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-CO2 MT-ND4 RPS27

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

While fibroblast heterogeneity is well established, this phenomenon has not been analyzed systematically yet. We have used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptomes of more than 5,000 fibroblasts from a sun-protected area in healthy human donors. Our results define four main subpopulations that can be spatially localized and show differential secretory, mesenchymal and pro-inflammatory functional annotations. Importantly, we found that this fibroblast priming becomes reduced with age. We also show that aging causes a substantial reduction in the predicted interactions between dermal fibroblasts and other skin cells, including undifferentiated keratinocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction. Our work thus provides evidence for a functional specialization of human dermal fibroblasts and identifies the partial loss of cellular identity as an important age-related change in the human dermis. These findings have important implications for understanding human skin aging and its associated phenotypes. scRNA-seq analysis of sun-protected human skin The anatomy of the skin can vary considerably depending on a number of endogenous and environmental factors28,29. Single-cell transcriptomics currently represents the most effective method to define cell populations in a given tissue51,52.\nDataset: Cell Type: T cell, Tissue: zone of skin, Gene Expression: MALAT1

We constructed a cellular taxonomy of one cortical region, primary visual cortex, in adult mice on the basis of single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 49 transcriptomic cell types, including 23 GABAergic, 19 glutamatergic and 7 non-neuronal types. We also analyzed cell typespecific mRNA processing and characterized genetic access to these transcriptomic types by many transgenic Cre lines. Finally, we found that some of our transcriptomic cell types displayed specific and differential electrophysiological and axon projection properties, thereby confirming that the single-cell transcriptomic signatures can be associated with specific cellular properties. Cell-type identification To minimize the potential variability in cell types as a result of differences in cortical region, age and sex, we focused on a single cortical area in adult 8-week-old male mice. The adult mouse visual cortex contains about 1,000,000 cells, of which about half are neurons48 that can be divided into glutamatergic 80 and GABAergic cells 2049.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium.

In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005).

Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types.

Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-\u03b2 mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states\u2013F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\nDataset: Cell Type: pericyte, Tissue: isthmus of fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TAGLN C11ORF96 EEF1A1 ACTA2 RPLP1 MYL9 TPM2 MT-CO1 RPL10 ADIRF MT-ATP6 MT-CYB VIM RPL41 ACTB MT2A

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium.

The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005).

Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease.

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental.

CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type.

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental. Download figureOpen in new tab : Subtypes of ciliated cells. A. B-E. F. CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium. Download figureOpen in new tab . Velocity analysis that uncovers two potential progenitor populations. A. B. C. In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005). Download figureOpen in new tab : Comparison of epithelial and stromal populations between healthy and disease status. A. B. C. D. E, F. Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types.

Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-\u03b2 mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states\u2013F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\nDataset: Cell Type: smooth muscle cell, Tissue: fallopian tube, Disease: hydrosalpinx, Gene Expression: TAGLN TPM2 ACTA2 MGP MALAT1 MT-CO1 EEF1A1 ACTB FTH1 TMSB4X MYL6 SPARCL1 RPLP1 TPM1

Here we applied single-cell RNAseq to profile 53,376 FT cells from 3 healthy pre-menopausal subjects. The resulting cell atlas contains 12 major cell types representing epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. Re-clustering of epithelial cells identified 4 ciliated and 6 non-ciliated secretory epithelial subtypes, two of which represent potential progenitor pools: one leading to mature secretory cells, while the other contributing to either ciliated cells or one of the stromal cell types. To understand how FT cell numbers and states change in a disease state, we analyzed ~15,000 cells from a hydrosalpinx sample and observed shifts in epithelial and stromal populations, and cell type-specific changes in extracellular matrix and TGF-\u03b2 signaling, underscoring fibrosis pathophysiology. This resource is expected to facilitate future studies to understand fallopian tube homeostasis in normal development and disease. RESULTS Systematic analysis of fallopian tube from 3 healthy individuals revealed 12 major cell types To ensure that our tissue dissociation protocol was sufficiently robust to include the full range of FT cell heterogeneity, we dissected a benign surgical sample (FT1) into three segments, fimbria, isthmus and ampulla.

To exploit the full power of the entire data we pooled the total set of 53,376 pass-QC cells from the 3 subjects, at an average of ~2.6K detected genes per cell. Identification and characterization of four ciliated epithelial subtypes By re-clustering the ~2.5K ciliated epithelial cells identified in the global analysis we identified four molecularly defined subtypes, which were positive for FOXJ1 and CAPS and were contributed comparably by the three individuals (Supplemental.

CE1-3 cells express genes involved in antigen processing (CD74), presentation (HLA-DMA, HLA-DRB1), and chemokine/cytokines (CCL20, CXCL1-3) (Supplemental Table 4; examples in. Focused analysis of non-ciliated epithelial cells identified six subtypes Re-clustering of the ~14,000 non-ciliated epithelial cells from FT1, FT2 and FT4 identified 6 molecular subtypes, contributed comparably by the three subjects (Supplemental, and are named NCSE2-1 through NCSE2-6.

NCSE2-1cells account for 1.6-2% of the NCSEs (Supplemental, and express EMT markers ACTA2, ZEB1, SNAI, LGALS1, SPARC, and endothelial cell markers CAVIN2, PECAM, VWF, E). Like NCSE2-1, NCSE2-2 cells express EMT markers ACTA2, COL1A1, MMP2, PRRX1, TWIST2, DES, DCN, FN1, ZEB1, TIMP3, LGALS1, SPARC, E; Supplemental Table 5), but lack any terminal differentiation markers of epithelial cells, consistent with a progenitor-like cell. NCSE2-3 to 2-5 are the most abundant subtypes, collectively comprising ~80% of NCSE (Supplemental. Finally, NCSE2-6 cells express lymphoid lineage markers RUNX3, CD3E, PTPRC, H), consistent with a basal or resident memory T-cells identity. Taken together, our analysis of ~16,500 NCSE and CE cells provided a fine-grained catalog of cellular diversity of the fallopian tube epithelium. Subtle transcriptomic differences are observed across anatomic segments Although cell type composition is largely similar across the fallopian tube segments, we explored if there are between-segment transcriptomic differences within each cell type. Identification of six stromal subtypes in human fallopian tube The global clustering involved ~26,400 stromal cells and identified six stromal cell types (re-projected in, which are evenly contributed by the three subjects (Supplemental.

Like the epithelial cells, the stromal cell types display subtle differences in gene expression across segments (Supplemental Table 6). Identification of multiple progenitor populations that possibly contribute to epithelial and stromal cell homeostasis Marker genes of NCSE2-5 and NCSE2-2 suggest that these populations may be progenitor cell populations in the fallopian tube epithelium. Download figureOpen in new tab . Velocity analysis that uncovers two potential progenitor populations. A. B. C. In addition to contributing to the stroma, NCSE2-2 cells also feed into the ciliated cells; thus, they are potentially responsible for the replenishment of ciliated cells. In sum, our trajectory analysis suggests that the fallopian tube has multiple progenitor populations that maintain multiple epithelial and stromal cell subpopulations in this dynamically regulated organ. The hydrosalpinx tube had altered cell type proportions and cell states In ultrastructure studies, the hydrosalpinx tube appears as a denuded epithelium with loss of cilia and microvilli, containing disordered edematous stroma with atrophic and distorted muscle fibers, and engorged blood vessels (Ajonuma et al. 2005). Download figureOpen in new tab : Comparison of epithelial and stromal populations between healthy and disease status. A. B. C. D. E, F. Next, we performed differential expression analysis between the healthy and disease samples within each epithelial and stromal cell type. In addition to the differences in progenitor markers, the differentially expressed genes revealed changes in the complement pathway, cellular redox, and WNT signaling pathways (Supplemental Table 8), consistent with previous analyses of hydrosalpinx. Unexpectedly, the hydrosalpinx sample showed differences in genes associated with cell-to-cell adhesion and ECM-related processes. Changes in ECM genes in hydrosalpinx raised the possibility that it represents a fibrotic disease. DISCUSSION A refined cell atlas of the pre-menopausal fallopian tube We used single-cell RNA-seq to establish a new catalog of cell types, subtypes, and mRNA markers for the healthy human fallopian tube, and identified 12 major cell types. Download figureOpen in new tab : Model for epithelial differentiation trajectory A. B. C. A recent study by Dinh et. al. profiled human fallopian tube samples using 10X Chromium (Dinh et al. 2021). Next, we sought to understand whether hormonal states could influence the progenitor populations we identified. Potential role of TGF-\u03b2 mediated tissue fibrosis in hydrosalpinx Our analysis of the hydrosalpinx sample revealed changes in both tissue composition (i.e., cell number,, S6A) and regulatory states\u2013F, S6B-C). In addition to changes in progenitor cells, the epithelial and stromal populations express higher levels ECM-related genes, which led us to explore whether the hydrosalpinx disease state may have fibrosis-related tissue damage. In summary, by sequencing >53K cells from three tubal segments in three healthy subjects we produced a detailed cell atlas of the human fallopian tube, allowing comparisons across anatomic segments of the tube.\nDataset: Cell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: ampulla of uterine tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 RPL41 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-CYB MT-ATP6 FTH1 MT-CO2 MT-ND3 RPL13 RPL10 RPS8 TPT1 RPLP1 RPS4X MT-ND4 RPS27A RPL34 RPS14 HSP90AA1 RPL11 RPS12 H3-3B PTMA RPS27 RPL7A RPS24 RPL32 RPS3A RPS19 CAPS RPL26 RPL19 RPL30 RPL3 RPS6 RPL28 RPS23 RPL29 RPS18 RPL12 RPL8 RPL35A RPL21 RPL17 RPS2 RPL10A UBC RPS3 RPL5 RPS15 RPS28 S100A6 GSTP1 WFDC2 RPS25 MT-ND2 TUBB4B RPL6 RPL37 RPL14 RPL39 PRDX5 RPL18 RPL18A RPL36 RPL37A RPS15A FAU S100A11 SLPI RPL24 RPS13 RPL9 RPL13A RPS9 MT-ND1 ACTG1 RPL15 RPS7 TXN DYNLL1 CALM2 C20ORF85 H3-3A EIF1 CALM1 FOS RPLP0 NACA RPL23A RPS21 RPS5 RPS16 IGFBP7 ACTB RPL35 RACK1 TPPP3\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ND3 MT-CYB MT-ATP6 MT-CO2 CAPS MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-ND4 FTH1 HSP90AA1 EEF1A1 MT-ND2 RPL41 IGFBP7 TXN TMEM190 DYNLL1 TMSB10 RPL13 MT-ND1 PTMA WFDC2 H3-3B B2M C20ORF85 RPS8 CALM1 TPT1 S100A11 TPPP3 RPS27A RPS27 C9ORF24 TFF3 PRDX5 RPL34 H3-3A RPL10 MT-ND5 RPLP1 RBP1 RPS4X RPS14 GSTP1 UBC RPS24 RPL11 RPL28 SCGB1D4 C1ORF194 RPL13A RPS3A RPL21 S100A6 AGR3 RPL19 TUBB4B RPL37A RPL30 MIF CALM2 RPL17 RPS18 RSPH1 ATP5IF1 HSP90AB1 RPL3 PIFO MYL6 RPL26 RPL7A RPS28 RPS19 RPL32 HOATZ RPL9 VIM RPL35A CKB RPS15 ATP5F1E EIF1 CETN2 RPS29 SNTN RPS6 HMGN3 RPL36 FAU RPS23 ITM2B AGR2 SAT1 RPL15 RPS12 RPL29 RPL23A HSPB1 RPL8\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: fimbria of uterine tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-ATP6 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 MT-CYB FTH1 MT-CO2 RPL41 MT-ND3 EEF1A1 RPL13 TPT1 MT-ND4 RPLP1 RPL10 RPS8 RPS4X CAPS HSP90AA1 RPS14 RPS27A RPL34 RPL11 PTMA S100A11 H3-3B RPS24 RPS27 RPS6 RPS12 RPL32 RPS19 WFDC2 UBC RPL28 RPL7A RPS3A RPS18 RPL19 RPL3 RPL26 GSTP1 S100A6 RPL21 RPL30 RPL12 TUBB4B MT-ND2 SLPI RPL29 RPL17 MT-ND1 RPS23 RPL8 RPS2 JUNB DYNLL1 SAT1 EIF1 TXN RPL35A RPS15 IGFBP7 PRDX5 ACTG1 AGR2 RPS28 C20ORF85 RPL13A RPL10A RPL18A FOS RPL37A RPL6 RPS13 B2M RPS9 H3-3A RPL5 RPS25 RPL37 RPS3 RPL9 RPL18 CALM1 RPL36 RPL15 RPL39 CALM2 FAU RPS15A RPL14 RPS7 RPL24 C9ORF24 KRT18 RPS16 RPL23A MIF RPL35\nCell Type: ciliated epithelial cell, Tissue: isthmus of fallopian tube, Gene Expression: MALAT1 EEF1A1 FTH1 RPL41 MT-ATP6 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-CYB MT-CO2 TPT1 MT-ND3 CAPS HSP90AA1 RPL13 RPLP1 RPS8 MT-ND4 RPL10 H3-3B PTMA RPS4X RPS27A RPL34 RPS24 GSTP1 TUBB4B RPL11 RPS14 S100A11 RPL19 RPS27 DYNLL1 RPS3A RPL32 TXN RPL3 RPL28 RPL7A CALM2 RPL26 RPS6 RPL30 RPL21 C20ORF85 PRDX5 RPS12 WFDC2 UBC RPS23 RPS19 S100A6 RPL6 CALM1 H3-3A RPL12 TMSB10 MT-ND2 RPL35A RPL8 RPS18 HSP90AB1 IGFBP7 RPL29 RPS15 RPS28 RPL39 RPL10A RPS25 C9ORF24 RPL5 RPL24 RPL37A RPL36 RPS7 RPL37 RPL18A RPL9 MT-ND1 FAU RPL15 RPL14 RPS13 RPS2 RPS3 EIF1 RPS15A MIF RPS9 RPL13A RPL17 C1ORF194 RPS16 CKB RPL18 RPL23A NACA HSPB1 SLPI B2M PIFO\n"}]}}

Here, we simultaneously assess microbiota and single immune cells across the healthy, adult human colon, with paired characterization of immune cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes, to delineate colonic immune niches at steady state. We describe distinct helper T cell activation and migration profiles along the colon and characterize the transcriptional adaptation trajectory of regulatory T cells between lymphoid tissue and colon. Finally, we show increasing B cell accumulation, clonal expansion and mutational frequency from the cecum to the sigmoid colon and link this to the increasing number of reactive bacterial species. Microbiome composition differs along distinct colon regions To create a map of bacterial composition at the mucosal surface of the colon, we performed 16S ribosomal RNA 16S rRNA sequencing of swabs from the mucosal surface of the cecum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon of 12 disease-free deceased transplant donors of European ancestry Methods, and Supplementary Table 1. In this study, we performed the first simultaneous assessment of the colonic mucosal microbiome and immune cells in human donors at steady state.\nDataset: Cell Type: plasmacytoid dendritic cell,

The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question.

Enhanced understanding of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and pathogenesis is critical for the development of therapeutics. To provide insight into viral replication, cell tropism, and host\u2013viral interactions of SARS-CoV-2, we performed single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of experimentally infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) cultures over a time course. This revealed novel polyadenylated viral transcripts and highlighted ciliated cells as a major target at the onset of infection, which we confirmed by electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Over the course of infection, the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 expands to other epithelial cell types including basal and club cells. Infection induces cell-intrinsic expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs) and interleukin (IL)-6 but not IL-1. This results in expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both infected and bystander cells. This provides a detailed characterization of genes, cell types, and cell state changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human airway. Results Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human bronchial epithelial cells To characterize SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the human airway, we performed scRNA-seq of SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected airway epithelium.

Our data reveal several novel viral transcripts, and our methodology differentiated infected from bystander cells. COVID-19 pathogenesis is characterized by a lag following viral transmission with symptom onset at day 7 and disease severity peaking 14 dpi [51,52]. By assessing the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2\u2013infected bronchial epithelial cells, we observed up-regulation of genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and translation initiation and viral gene expression.\nDataset: Cell Type: lung neuroendocrine cell, Tissue: bronchial epithelial cell (cell culture), Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 S100A6 MT-CO1 MT-CO2 MT-ND3 TFF3 TMSB4X IGFBP5
