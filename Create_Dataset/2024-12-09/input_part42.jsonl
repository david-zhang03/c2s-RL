To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of 85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90 of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing. Cell classes in human retina To generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human retina, we obtained eight retinas from seven genetically unrelated human donors with no clinical history of ocular disease Table S1. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq to generate a cell atlas of the adult human retina.\nDataset: Cell Type: Mueller cell, Tissue: fovea centralis, Gene Expression: MALAT1 APOE CLU GLUL GAPDH

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of 85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90 of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing.
