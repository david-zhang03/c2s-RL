Although AD progression is characterized by stereotyped accumulation of proteinopathies, the affected cellular populations remain understudied. Here we use multiomics, spatial genomics and reference atlases from the BRAIN Initiative to study middle temporal gyrus cell types in 84 donors with varying AD pathologies. This cohort includes 33 male donors and 51 female donors, with an average age at time of death of 88 years. We used quantitative neuropathology to place donors along a disease pseudoprogression score. Pseudoprogression analysis revealed two disease phases: an early phase with a slow increase in pathology, presence of inflammatory microglia, reactive astrocytes, loss of somatostatin inhibitory neurons, and a remyelination response by oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and a later phase with exponential increase in pathology, loss of excitatory neurons and Pvalb and Vip inhibitory neuron subtypes. These findings were replicated in other major AD studies. Profiling AD progression across pathological stages To construct an integrated multimodal cellular atlas of AD and comorbid related disorders ADAD and related dementias we generated 1 quantitative neuropathological measurements, 2 single-nucleus RNA sequencing snRNA-seq, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing snATACseq and single-nucleus multiome snMultiome, and 3 cellularly resolved spatial transcriptomics multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization MERFISH in the MTG from a cohort of 84 aged donors spanning the spectrum of AD pathology and Extended Data. We describe an integrated atlas of AD in the MTG, selected both as a transition area in AD pathology4 and the region with the greatest aggregated knowledge about cell type phenotypes20,21,22.\nDataset: Cell Type: near-projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron, Tissue: middle temporal gyrus, Disease: dementia, Gene Expression: MALAT1 RBFOX1 LRP1B SNHG14 NRG3 NRXN1 DPP10 CNTNAP2 CADM2 ZNF385D CSMD1 NKAIN2 SYT1 OPCML NLGN1 DLG2 ADGRB3 ASIC2 SNTG1 PCDH9 ANKS1B MDGA2 PTPRD NEGR1 FRMD4A FAM155A NAV3 MEG3 FGF14 TSHZ2 DAB1 PLCB1 KHDRBS2 RYR2 DSCAM PDE4D CELF2 CDH18 IL1RAPL1 RORA AUTS2 KAZN LSAMP RGS7 NRXN3 ANK3 LRRC7 LRRC4C MAGI2 HTR2C ANK2 FRMPD4 MAPK10 GPM6A PHACTR1 MACROD2 DCLK1 RALYL AGBL4 DLGAP1 FTX CSMD3 GRM5 ZNF385B SLC8A1 RIMS2 CCSER1 RP11-419I17-1 LDB2 FGF12 OXR1 GRIP1 ERC2 OLFM3 CADPS NBEA DOCK4 CNTN4 DLGAP2 MYT1L SPOCK1 SOX5 KIAA1217 STXBP5L GRIA4 PCDH7 KALRN CTNND2 GRIN2A SLC24A2 KCNMA1 DOCK3 MYRIP LINGO2 CHSY3 MAP2 ADGRL3 PTPRN2 CACNA1A CLSTN2\nCell Type: near-projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron, Tissue: middle temporal gyrus, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 RBFOX1 LRP1B SNHG14 DPP10 NRXN1 NRG3 CNTNAP2 ZNF385D CADM2 CSMD1 NKAIN2 OPCML NLGN1 SYT1 ASIC2 PCDH9 DLG2 PTPRD MEG3 ADGRB3 SNTG1 ANKS1B MDGA2 FRMD4A NAV3 FAM155A NEGR1 FGF14 DAB1 TSHZ2 PLCB1 DSCAM RYR2 HTR2C CELF2 PDE4D KHDRBS2 IL1RAPL1 NRXN3 KAZN RGS7 RORA CDH18 RP11-419I17-1 LSAMP ANK3 MAPK10 AUTS2 DCLK1 AGBL4 MACROD2 FRMPD4 LRRC4C ANK2 DLGAP1 GPM6A LRRC7 FTX PHACTR1 MAGI2 CSMD3 GRM5 ERC2 ZNF385B CCSER1 LDB2 RALYL RIMS2 SLC8A1 OXR1 GRIP1 OLFM3 CNTN4 FGF12 SPOCK1 DOCK4 NBEA CADPS DLGAP2 KIAA1217 SLC24A2 GRIN2A SOX5 GRIA4 MYT1L KALRN CTNND2 LINGO2 MYRIP PCDH7 STXBP5L KCNMA1 DOCK3 ADGRL3 ADCY2 CLSTN2 CHSY3 HS6ST3 CDH13\n"}]}}

We describe an integrated atlas of AD in the MTG, selected both as a transition area in AD pathology4 and the region with the greatest aggregated knowledge about cell type phenotypes20,21,22.\nDataset: Cell Type: L2/3-6 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron, Tissue: middle temporal gyrus, Disease: dementia, Gene Expression: MALAT1 KCNIP4 RBFOX1 CADM2 LRP1B SYT1 OPCML SNHG14 PTPRD DPP10 ADGRB3 NRG3 PCDH9 NRXN1 CTNNA2 CSMD1 DLG2 RALYL CNTNAP2 LSAMP PDE4D FAM155A NRXN3 ANKS1B NKAIN2 IQCJ-SCHIP1 FGF14 KCNQ5 NAV3 LRRTM4 NEGR1 RYR2 FRMD4A SNTG1 PHACTR1 MAGI2 CELF2 DLGAP1 ANK2 KAZN MDGA2 FRMPD4 CCSER1 ADGRL3 STXBP5L RORA AGBL4 CNTN5 MEG3 KALRN FGF12 CTNND2 LRRC7 DSCAM NRG1 TAFA2 FTX RIMS2 PCDH7 DLGAP2 CLSTN2 PPP3CA MAPK10 PLCB1 NLGN1 PDE1A OXR1 KHDRBS2 MACROD2 DMD ROBO2 PTPRT CACNA1C KCNMA1 PPP2R2B DOCK3 CSMD3 PCLO KCNH7 KCNQ3 GRM5 RGS7 MYT1L NBEA GPM6A AUTS2 CNTN1 ATRNL1 MIR99AHG ANK3 ARPP21 LRFN5 RP11-384F7 GRIK2 CADPS2 R3HDM1 KHDRBS3 MEF2C HECW1 THRB\nCell Type: L2/3-6 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron, Tissue: middle temporal gyrus, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 KCNIP4 RBFOX1 CADM2 LRP1B PTPRD SYT1 OPCML DPP10 SNHG14 CTNNA2 ADGRB3 NRXN3 PCDH9 NRG3 PDE4D CSMD1 NRXN1 DLG2 CNTNAP2 RALYL NKAIN2 LSAMP ANKS1B FAM155A NAV3 PHACTR1 KCNQ5 FGF14 LRRTM4 IQCJ-SCHIP1 FRMD4A RYR2 CELF2 DLGAP1 NEGR1 MEG3 MAGI2 CCSER1 SNTG1 KAZN MDGA2 ANK2 STXBP5L FRMPD4 AGBL4 KALRN ADGRL3 CTNND2 CNTN5 NRG1 FTX DSCAM LRRC7 FGF12 ROBO2 PLCB1 RIMS2 PCDH7 DLGAP2 DMD NLGN1 CLSTN2 OXR1 RORA MAPK10 PDE1A TAFA2 KCNMA1 MACROD2 ATRNL1 PPP3CA DOCK3 RGS7 CSMD3 KCNQ3 PPP2R2B PTPRT PCLO GRM5 CACNA1C KHDRBS2 KHDRBS3 GPM6A NBEA ANK3 KCNH7 GRIK2 THRB AUTS2 ERC2 CADPS2 ARPP21 LRFN5 CNTN1 RP11-384F7 NRCAM R3HDM1 HECW1 MEF2C\n"}]}}

Incomplete genetic penetrance and ample phenotypic expressivity in CVID suggest the participation of additional pathogenic mechanisms. Monozygotic MZ twins discordant for CVID are uniquely valuable for studying the contribution of epigenetics to the disease. Here, we generate a single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics census of na\u00efve-to-memory B cell differentiation in a CVID-discordant MZ twin pair. Our analysis identifies DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and transcriptional defects in memory B-cells mirroring defective cell-cell communication upon activation. These findings are validated in a cohort of CVID patients and healthy donors. Our findings provide a comprehensive multi-omics map of alterations in na\u00efve-to-memory B-cell transition in CVID and indicate links between the epigenome and immune cell cross-talk. Our resource, publicly available at the Human Cell Atlas, gives insight into future diagnosis and treatments of CVID patients. DNA methylation alterations in CVID in memory B-cell differentiation To define the DNA methylation profiles in CVID, we performed single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of B cells isolated from a pair of CVID-discordant MZ twins without identified pathogenic mutations. In this study, the use of multi-omics single-cell atlas technologies allowed us to identify functional alterations occurring in specific scarce immune cell populations that would have gone undetected if conventional bulk-based approaches had been used.\nDataset: Cell Type: class switched memory B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: common variable immunodeficiency, Gene Expression: MALAT1 CD74 MT-CO1 B2M MT-CO3 EEF1A1 MT-CYB HLA-B MT-ND4 RPS27 ACTB RPL3 MT-CO2 MT-ND1 HLA-DRA RPL13A MT-ND5 TMSB4X RPLP1 RPS18 MT-ND2 HLA-C RPS3 RPS14 MT-ATP6 PTMA LAPTM5 RPL13 RPS6 HLA-A RPL11 RPS27A RPL21 RPS19 RPL19 RPL8 RPL7 RPL5 RPS2 RPLP2 RPL27A RPL31 CD79A RPL10 RPL34 RPLP0 RPL32 RPL4 RPS4X RPS13 FTL RPS12 RPL9 RPL15 RPS11 RPL18 CXCR4 MT-ND4L RPL18A EZR HLA-E EIF1 TXNIP RPS5 COX4I1 RPS15 HLA-DRB1 RPL37 RPL37A RPS20 HLA-DPB1 RPS16 RPS29 RPL6 RPL36 SYNGR2 RPL7A NFKBIA PABPC1 RPSA RPS7 RPL41 RPS25 RPL10A BTG1 HNRNPA1 RPS3A RPS8 RPS9 RPL29 RPS24 DDX5 IGHA1 RPL27 HLA-DQB1 RPL35A EEF1B2 HLA-DPA1 RPL14 UBA52\nCell Type: class switched memory B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 CD74 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 B2M EEF1A1 MT-CYB HLA-B RPS27 RPL3 MT-ND4 ACTB MT-CO2 MT-ND1 RPL13A RPS14 RPLP1 HLA-DRA RPS18 MT-ND5 RPS3 RPL13 HLA-C PTMA MT-ATP6 MT-ND2 RPS6 TMSB4X HLA-A LAPTM5 RPL21 RPS27A RPS19 RPL8 RPL11 RPLP2 RPL10 RPL5 RPL31 RPL27A RPL19 RPL34 RPL7 TXNIP RPL32 RPLP0 RPL4 RPL15 RPS12 CXCR4 FTL RPS2 RPL9 NFKBIA RPS13 EZR RPL18 CD79A RPS4X MT-ND4L EIF1 RPL18A RPS11 RPS15 HLA-E RPS29 RPL6 RPS5 RPL37A RPS16 RPL37 RPS20 RPL36 SYNGR2 COX4I1 RPL10A RPS25 PABPC1 RPSA RPS7 RPS9 RPS8 HLA-DRB1 EEF1B2 RPL7A RPL41 RPL27 HLA-DPB1 RPS3A RPL14 RPL29 RPS26 TAGLN2 HNRNPA1 RPS24 RPL35A RPL12 UBC DDX5 PPIA\nCell Type: naive B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: common variable immunodeficiency, Gene Expression: CD74 MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 B2M RPS27 MT-CYB EEF1A1 MT-CO2 MT-ND4 HLA-B LAPTM5 MT-ND1 RPL13A MT-ATP6 MT-ND2 RPLP1 RPL3 MT-ND5 RPS27A RPS18 RPL13 RPL21 RPS14 RPS19 RPL34 RPL11 RPS3 PTMA RPLP2 HLA-DRA RPL32 RPL7 RPL31 RPL27A RPS6 RPL19 CD79A CXCR4 RPL8 RPS2 RPS13 RPL10 HLA-C RPL18A RPS11 RPL9 TMSB4X RPS12 RPL37 RPS29 EZR BTG1 RPL5 IGHM RPLP0 RPL37A RPL18 HLA-A RPL15 MT-ND4L ACTB RPS4X RPS15 EIF1 COX4I1 TXNIP RPL36 FTL RPL12 RPL4 RPS20 MT-ND3 RPL27 RPS26 RPS3A RPL41 IGHD FAU RPS16 ADAM28 RPS9 RPL35A UBA52 RPS25 RPL6 RPL35 HLA-DPB1 RPS5 RPS28 NFKBIA RPS8 RPL29 RPL23 RPL7A RPS7 RPS24 RPSA PABPC1 RPL14\nCell Type: naive B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: CD74 MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-CO1 RPS27 B2M EEF1A1 MT-CYB LAPTM5 MT-ND4 RPL13A MT-CO2 HLA-B RPS27A RPS19 RPL13 MT-ATP6 MT-ND1 RPS18 RPL21 RPLP1 RPL3 RPS14 MT-ND2 CD79A MT-ND5 RPS3 RPL34 RPS6 CXCR4 RPLP2 RPL32 RPL11 RPL19 RPL7 PTMA RPL10 RPL8 RPL31 HLA-DRA RPL9 RPS29 BTG1 RPS12 RPL18A RPS13 RPL27A TXNIP RPL37 HLA-C RPS11 EZR RPL15 RPL37A IGHM ACTB TMSB4X RPS4X RPLP0 RPL18 RPS15 RPL5 COX4I1 MT-ND4L RPL36 RPS3A RPS20 RPL41 RPS2 RPL4 RPL35A HLA-A RPS26 RPL12 MT-ND3 RPS16 FAU RPL27 EIF1 IGHD RPS5 RPS25 RPS24 FTL UBA52 CD83 RPL10A RPS9 ADAM28 RPS8 RPS7 RPL35 RPL7A RPL39 RPS28 RPL6 RPL23 RPS21 PABPC1 TSC22D3\nCell Type: unswitched memory B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: common variable immunodeficiency, Gene Expression: MALAT1 CD74 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 B2M EEF1A1 MT-CYB HLA-B RPS27 LAPTM5 MT-ND4 ACTB RPL3 RPL13A MT-ND1 MT-CO2 HLA-DRA MT-ND5 PTMA RPS18 MT-ND2 MT-ATP6 RPL13 RPS3 RPS14 RPLP1 HLA-C RPS6 CD79A IGHM RPS27A HLA-A RPL8 RPL21 RPS19 TMSB4X RPL11 RPL34 RPL19 RPS2 RPL10 RPLP2 RPL31 RPL27A RPL32 RPL5 RPL7 RPS4X CXCR4 RPS13 EZR RPL4 RPL9 RPS12 BTG1 RPL18 RPLP0 RPS11 FTL RPL15 RPL18A MT-ND4L RPS15 HLA-DPB1 EIF1 HLA-E HLA-DRB1 RPL37 RPS16 COX4I1 RPL37A RPL6 RPS29 RPL7A RPS5 SYNGR2 RPS20 RPL36 PABPC1 RPS9 TNFRSF13C RGS2 TXNIP RPSA RPL10A RPL41 RPS8 RPS7 RPL29 HLA-DQB1 RPL12 RPS24 EEF1B2 RPL14 RPS25 RPS3A DDX5 ARPC2 CFL1 RPL35A\nCell Type: unswitched memory B cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: MALAT1 CD74 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 B2M EEF1A1 MT-CYB HLA-B LAPTM5 RPS27 MT-ND4 RPL3 HLA-DRA RPL13A ACTB MT-ND1 MT-CO2 PTMA RPS14 CD79A MT-ND5 MT-ATP6 RPS18 RPS3 RPLP1 HLA-C RPL13 MT-ND2 RPS6 RPS27A RPS19 RPL11 EZR RPL21 HLA-A RPL27A RPL31 RPL8 RPLP2 CXCR4 RPL5 RPL34 RPL19 RPL10 RPS4X TMSB4X RPL7 RPL4 RPL32 FTL RPS2 RPLP0 RPL9 RPL18 IGHM RPS11 RPS13 BTG1 RPS12 MT-ND4L RPL15 RPL18A EIF1 COX4I1 RPL37 RPS29 RPS15 RPL6 TNFRSF13C RPL37A HLA-DPB1 HLA-E RPL7A RPS20 RPS16 RPS5 PABPC1 SYNGR2 TXNIP TSC22D3 RPL36 RPSA HLA-DRB1 RPL10A RGS2 RPS8 RPL41 RPS9 RPS3A DDX5 RPS25 UBC RPL14 EEF1B2 RPS7 RPS24 NFKBIA RPL35A MT-ND3 RPL12\n"}]}}

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

Incomplete genetic penetrance and ample phenotypic expressivity in CVID suggest the participation of additional pathogenic mechanisms. Monozygotic MZ twins discordant for CVID are uniquely valuable for studying the contribution of epigenetics to the disease. Here, we generate a single-cell epigenomics and transcriptomics census of na\u00efve-to-memory B cell differentiation in a CVID-discordant MZ twin pair. Our analysis identifies DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and transcriptional defects in memory B-cells mirroring defective cell-cell communication upon activation. These findings are validated in a cohort of CVID patients and healthy donors. Our findings provide a comprehensive multi-omics map of alterations in na\u00efve-to-memory B-cell transition in CVID and indicate links between the epigenome and immune cell cross-talk. Our resource, publicly available at the Human Cell Atlas, gives insight into future diagnosis and treatments of CVID patients. DNA methylation alterations in CVID in memory B-cell differentiation To define the DNA methylation profiles in CVID, we performed single-cell whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of B cells isolated from a pair of CVID-discordant MZ twins without identified pathogenic mutations. In this study, the use of multi-omics single-cell atlas technologies allowed us to identify functional alterations occurring in specific scarce immune cell populations that would have gone undetected if conventional bulk-based approaches had been used.\nDataset: Cell Type: mucosal invariant T cell, Tissue: blood, Disease: common variable immunodeficiency, Gene Expression: MT-CO1 MT-CO2 MALAT1 B2M

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

A) Deletion of the SBE1 and SBE5 enhancers leads to a loss of Shh expression and Shh signaling activity in the caudal diencephalon. A high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos To uncover the molecular logic driving the specification of distinct thalamic nuclei, we generated a high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos. Our analysis identified 23 distinct cell populations, comprising most of the known cell types in the caudal diencephalon (Figs. 1D and E). Of note, we found that these data correctly recapitulated the effect of SBE1/5 deletions on the expression of Shh and Shh target genes. Most thalamic nuclei have well-defined molecular identities at E18.5 Gene expression signatures of distinct thalamic nuclei have been described in adult mice or at single stages of embryonic development, but not in a coordinated manner across developmental time 2,25,34,40,41,45.

A) UMAP representation of the mRNA expression data of E18.5 control cells from the post-mitotic cTh.N, rTh.N, ZI, habenula, and reticular complex cell populations. Shared genetic programs across distinct sensory modalities are established during embryogenesis Sensory inputs in the brain follow cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, where first order thalamic nuclei project peripheral sensory inputs onto the primary sensory cortex, and higher order thalamic nuclei receive their input from the primary sensory cortex and project it back to a secondary cortex 19,49,50. Thalamic progenitors are a heterogeneous cell population We next characterized the cellular heterogeneity of the Olig3+ progenitor subpopulation in E12.5 control embryos. Glutamatergic thalamic nuclei emerge sequentially through the coordinated action of three distinct cell lineages To uncover the transcriptomic lineages that relate thalamic progenitors at E12.5 to post-mitotic thalamic neurons at E18.5, we devised a semi-supervised approach for transferring the E12.5 and E18.5 cell annotations across all time points and identified cells with a similar gene expression profile (Methods).

A) UMAP representation and RNA velocity field of the single-cell RNA-seq data of the glutamatergic cell lineage in control embryos at each developmental stage. Each embryonic day was analyzed independently, since neurodevelopmental lineages may change across time as a consequence of shifts in the progenitor identities. Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages.

Locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice We next assessed the consequences that abnormal thalamic development might have on animal behavior in \u0394SBE1/5 mutant mice. \u0394SBE1/5 mice are viable and exhibit reduced locomotor activity and rearing in the open field, as well as a significantly impaired initial coordination and subsequent motor learning on the accelerating rotarod test. The nigrostriatal pathway is a critical component of the basal ganglia motor circuit that degenerates in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. For several reasons, we favor the loss of motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) as a likely explanation for the locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice. Discussion Our study provides a comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of thalamic progenitors and their trajectories into thalamic nuclei during embryonic stages of brain development.

Model of thalamic development. A) Thalamic progenitors are organized rostro-caudally in the neural tube and acquire distinct identities based on their exposure to the Shh morphogen gradient originating from the ZLI and basal plate (top). Consistent with this model, our scRNA-seq analysis also identified heterogeneity in the IPC lineage. The transcriptional profiles of thalamic nuclei at early postnatal stages were previously shown to be more discriminative when classified based on hierarchical order rather than by sensory modality 25. Deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms of thalamic dysfunction in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants provided novel insight into the etiology of a neurodevelopmental movement disorder with a similar phenotype to infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control volitional movement, as well as non-motor functions, and have been implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease and other movement disorders 67\u201370. Motor impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease is caused by the degeneration of dopamine expressing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, favoring activation of iMSNs over dMSNs 71. Recent studies have also implicated the thalamus in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathology 76\u201378. We propose that the motor impairment in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants is attributed to loss of the Shh-dependent cTh.Pro1 subtype of thalamic progenitors, resulting in a reduced number of Olig2+ Sox2+ IPCs and subsequently, fewer cTh.N1 thalamic neurons populating motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) during embryonic development.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MEG3 MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 MT-CO1 MT-CO2 TUBA1A ACTB TUBB2B ACTG1 SNHG11 MT-CYTB NNAT MT-ND4 RTN1 MAP1B BASP1 MT-ND1 TTC3 TUBB5 EEF1A1 MAPT HSP90AA1 NCAM1 STMN2 STMN1 PTMA MARCKS CPE UCHL1 TUBB3 TUBB2A NSG2 MT-ND2 TMSB4X TMSB10 GPM6A HSPA8 HSP90AB1 RPSA RPL41 CELF4 STMN3 GAP43 DPYSL2 PTMS GRIA2 SCD2 CALM1 SOX11 ELAVL3 HMGCS1 RPLP1 YWHAZ STMN4 EEF2 FNBP1L DPYSL3 MAP2 NDN CRMP1 YWHAG RPS8 TUBA1B H3F3B PPIA NRXN3 GPRASP1 PEG3 LY6H GNAS CELF2 CALM2 MAGED1 NREP EIF4G2 CAMTA1 PCSK1N NRXN1 YWHAE RPS15 COX4I1 RTN4 RTN3 GM1673 RPL38 HNRNPA2B1 NSG1 CHL1 MATR3 ZFHX3 ATP9A DCX RPS24 FUS CXADR OLFM1 ELAVL2 PSAP DDX5\nCell Type: glutamatergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MEG3 MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 TUBA1A MT-CO1 MT-CO2 ACTB TUBB2B ACTG1 MT-CYTB MT-ND4 MAP1B MT-ND1 RTN1 EEF1A1 TUBB5 TCF7L2 BASP1 TUBB3 NNAT MAPT HSP90AA1 TTC3 PTMA CELF2 MARCKS STMN2 STMN1 NCAM1 UCHL1 MT-ND2 NREP HSP90AB1 TMSB4X CPE PTMS SNHG11 RPL41 RPSA TUBB2A STMN3 TMSB10 ELAVL3 NSG2 EEF2 HSPA8 HMGCS1 DPYSL3 SOX11 YWHAZ CRMP1 SCD2 DPYSL2 RPLP1 EIF4G2 GAP43 MAP2 STMN4 NRXN1 RPS15 FNBP1L GPM6A YWHAG JUND SOX4 RPS8 GNAS RPL38 ZFHX3 PPIA YWHAE CALM1 GRIA2 DCX HNRNPA2B1 CELF4 RTN4 TPT1 H3F3B COX4I1 JPT1 RPL8 RPS24 TUBA1B DDX5 CADM2 MYL6 DCLK1 KITL MT-ND3 ZIC1 KIF1B RTN3 GM1673 PTPRS CAMTA1 PTN GNB1 SELENOW\n"}]}}

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

A high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos To uncover the molecular logic driving the specification of distinct thalamic nuclei, we generated a high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos. Our analysis identified 23 distinct cell populations, comprising most of the known cell types in the caudal diencephalon (Figs. 1D and E). Of note, we found that these data correctly recapitulated the effect of SBE1/5 deletions on the expression of Shh and Shh target genes. Most thalamic nuclei have well-defined molecular identities at E18.5 Gene expression signatures of distinct thalamic nuclei have been described in adult mice or at single stages of embryonic development, but not in a coordinated manner across developmental time 2,25,34,40,41,45.

Shared genetic programs across distinct sensory modalities are established during embryogenesis Sensory inputs in the brain follow cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, where first order thalamic nuclei project peripheral sensory inputs onto the primary sensory cortex, and higher order thalamic nuclei receive their input from the primary sensory cortex and project it back to a secondary cortex 19,49,50. Thalamic progenitors are a heterogeneous cell population We next characterized the cellular heterogeneity of the Olig3+ progenitor subpopulation in E12.5 control embryos. Glutamatergic thalamic nuclei emerge sequentially through the coordinated action of three distinct cell lineages To uncover the transcriptomic lineages that relate thalamic progenitors at E12.5 to post-mitotic thalamic neurons at E18.5, we devised a semi-supervised approach for transferring the E12.5 and E18.5 cell annotations across all time points and identified cells with a similar gene expression profile (Methods).

A) UMAP representation and RNA velocity field of the single-cell RNA-seq data of the glutamatergic cell lineage in control embryos at each developmental stage. Each embryonic day was analyzed independently, since neurodevelopmental lineages may change across time as a consequence of shifts in the progenitor identities. Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages.

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction. Results Deletion of SBE1 and SBE5 abrogates Shh expression in the ZLI Shh expression in the ZLI and basal plate of the caudal diencephalon is dependent on two Shh brain enhancers, SBE1 and SBE5 42.

A) Deletion of the SBE1 and SBE5 enhancers leads to a loss of Shh expression and Shh signaling activity in the caudal diencephalon. A high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos To uncover the molecular logic driving the specification of distinct thalamic nuclei, we generated a high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos. Our analysis identified 23 distinct cell populations, comprising most of the known cell types in the caudal diencephalon (Figs. 1D and E). Of note, we found that these data correctly recapitulated the effect of SBE1/5 deletions on the expression of Shh and Shh target genes. Most thalamic nuclei have well-defined molecular identities at E18.5 Gene expression signatures of distinct thalamic nuclei have been described in adult mice or at single stages of embryonic development, but not in a coordinated manner across developmental time 2,25,34,40,41,45.

A) UMAP representation of the mRNA expression data of E18.5 control cells from the post-mitotic cTh.N, rTh.N, ZI, habenula, and reticular complex cell populations. Shared genetic programs across distinct sensory modalities are established during embryogenesis Sensory inputs in the brain follow cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, where first order thalamic nuclei project peripheral sensory inputs onto the primary sensory cortex, and higher order thalamic nuclei receive their input from the primary sensory cortex and project it back to a secondary cortex 19,49,50. Thalamic progenitors are a heterogeneous cell population We next characterized the cellular heterogeneity of the Olig3+ progenitor subpopulation in E12.5 control embryos. Glutamatergic thalamic nuclei emerge sequentially through the coordinated action of three distinct cell lineages To uncover the transcriptomic lineages that relate thalamic progenitors at E12.5 to post-mitotic thalamic neurons at E18.5, we devised a semi-supervised approach for transferring the E12.5 and E18.5 cell annotations across all time points and identified cells with a similar gene expression profile (Methods).

A) UMAP representation and RNA velocity field of the single-cell RNA-seq data of the glutamatergic cell lineage in control embryos at each developmental stage. Each embryonic day was analyzed independently, since neurodevelopmental lineages may change across time as a consequence of shifts in the progenitor identities. Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages. Shh signaling is required for rTh.Pro and cTh.Pro1 progenitor specification and expansion The inference of developmental trajectories from unperturbed single-cell transcriptomic data has proven to be misleading in some situations 55.

Nkx2-2 and Sox2 expressing thalamic nuclei are reduced in \u0394SBE1/5 mice Based on our model of thalamic development, the observed depletion of cTh.Pro1 progenitors in \u0394SBE1/5 embryos should lead to a failure in the development of Sox2-expressing cTh.N1 thalamic nuclei.

Locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice We next assessed the consequences that abnormal thalamic development might have on animal behavior in \u0394SBE1/5 mutant mice. \u0394SBE1/5 mice are viable and exhibit reduced locomotor activity and rearing in the open field, as well as a significantly impaired initial coordination and subsequent motor learning on the accelerating rotarod test. The nigrostriatal pathway is a critical component of the basal ganglia motor circuit that degenerates in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. For several reasons, we favor the loss of motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) as a likely explanation for the locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice. Discussion Our study provides a comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of thalamic progenitors and their trajectories into thalamic nuclei during embryonic stages of brain development. The bifurcation of lineage commitments according to thalamic progenitor identity is in general agreement with results from in vivo clonal analyses 33,34. Download figureOpen in new tab . Model of thalamic development. A) Thalamic progenitors are organized rostro-caudally in the neural tube and acquire distinct identities based on their exposure to the Shh morphogen gradient originating from the ZLI and basal plate (top). Consistent with this model, our scRNA-seq analysis also identified heterogeneity in the IPC lineage. The transcriptional profiles of thalamic nuclei at early postnatal stages were previously shown to be more discriminative when classified based on hierarchical order rather than by sensory modality 25. Deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms of thalamic dysfunction in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants provided novel insight into the etiology of a neurodevelopmental movement disorder with a similar phenotype to infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control volitional movement, as well as non-motor functions, and have been implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease and other movement disorders 67\u201370. Motor impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease is caused by the degeneration of dopamine expressing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, favoring activation of iMSNs over dMSNs 71. Recent studies have also implicated the thalamus in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathology 76\u201378. We propose that the motor impairment in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants is attributed to loss of the Shh-dependent cTh.Pro1 subtype of thalamic progenitors, resulting in a reduced number of Olig2+ Sox2+ IPCs and subsequently, fewer cTh.N1 thalamic neurons populating motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) during embryonic development.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression:

The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

A high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos To uncover the molecular logic driving the specification of distinct thalamic nuclei, we generated a high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq atlas of the developing caudal diencephalon in control and \u0394SBE1/5 embryos. Our analysis identified 23 distinct cell populations, comprising most of the known cell types in the caudal diencephalon (Figs. 1D and E). Of note, we found that these data correctly recapitulated the effect of SBE1/5 deletions on the expression of Shh and Shh target genes. Most thalamic nuclei have well-defined molecular identities at E18.5 Gene expression signatures of distinct thalamic nuclei have been described in adult mice or at single stages of embryonic development, but not in a coordinated manner across developmental time 2,25,34,40,41,45.

A) UMAP representation of the mRNA expression data of E18.5 control cells from the post-mitotic cTh.N, rTh.N, ZI, habenula, and reticular complex cell populations. Shared genetic programs across distinct sensory modalities are established during embryogenesis Sensory inputs in the brain follow cortico-thalamo-cortical loops, where first order thalamic nuclei project peripheral sensory inputs onto the primary sensory cortex, and higher order thalamic nuclei receive their input from the primary sensory cortex and project it back to a secondary cortex 19,49,50. Thalamic progenitors are a heterogeneous cell population We next characterized the cellular heterogeneity of the Olig3+ progenitor subpopulation in E12.5 control embryos. Glutamatergic thalamic nuclei emerge sequentially through the coordinated action of three distinct cell lineages To uncover the transcriptomic lineages that relate thalamic progenitors at E12.5 to post-mitotic thalamic neurons at E18.5, we devised a semi-supervised approach for transferring the E12.5 and E18.5 cell annotations across all time points and identified cells with a similar gene expression profile (Methods).

A) UMAP representation and RNA velocity field of the single-cell RNA-seq data of the glutamatergic cell lineage in control embryos at each developmental stage. Each embryonic day was analyzed independently, since neurodevelopmental lineages may change across time as a consequence of shifts in the progenitor identities. Our analysis revealed the sequential emergence of glutamatergic thalamic nuclei, where lateral and intermediate nuclei such as the AD/AV/AM, DLG/MG/VPL, PF, and Po differentiate first, and medial nuclei such as the CM, MD, and paraventricular (PV) differentiate later (Figs. 3A and B). To understand the relationship between these cell differentiation lineages and the observed diversity of thalamic nuclei and progenitors, we examined the expression of Sox2 and Foxp2 in these cell populations. Our analysis also revealed a separation of the cTh.N1 differentiation trajectories into Cadm1+ and Cadm1- sub-lineages. Glutamatergic thalamic IPCs are a heterogeneous population of cells with contributions from both cTh.Pro1 and cTh.Pro2/3 progenitors Despite our ability to transfer annotations across timepoints, a gene expression bottleneck within IPCs prevented us from relating the aforementioned transcriptomic cell lineages to individual thalamic progenitor identities. GABAergic neurons diverge from progenitors with a shared transcriptional identity To identify the molecular logic that drives the generation of a diverse pool of inhibitory neurons in the thalamus, we performed an analysis of the GABAergic cell populations similar to the one described above for glutamatergic cell lineages.

Locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice We next assessed the consequences that abnormal thalamic development might have on animal behavior in \u0394SBE1/5 mutant mice. \u0394SBE1/5 mice are viable and exhibit reduced locomotor activity and rearing in the open field, as well as a significantly impaired initial coordination and subsequent motor learning on the accelerating rotarod test. The nigrostriatal pathway is a critical component of the basal ganglia motor circuit that degenerates in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. For several reasons, we favor the loss of motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) as a likely explanation for the locomotor deficits in \u0394SBE1/5 mice. Discussion Our study provides a comprehensive transcriptome-wide analysis of thalamic progenitors and their trajectories into thalamic nuclei during embryonic stages of brain development.

Model of thalamic development. A) Thalamic progenitors are organized rostro-caudally in the neural tube and acquire distinct identities based on their exposure to the Shh morphogen gradient originating from the ZLI and basal plate (top). Consistent with this model, our scRNA-seq analysis also identified heterogeneity in the IPC lineage. The transcriptional profiles of thalamic nuclei at early postnatal stages were previously shown to be more discriminative when classified based on hierarchical order rather than by sensory modality 25. Deciphering the pathogenic mechanisms of thalamic dysfunction in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants provided novel insight into the etiology of a neurodevelopmental movement disorder with a similar phenotype to infantile Parkinson\u2019s disease. The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control volitional movement, as well as non-motor functions, and have been implicated in Parkinson\u2019s disease and other movement disorders 67\u201370. Motor impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease is caused by the degeneration of dopamine expressing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, favoring activation of iMSNs over dMSNs 71. Recent studies have also implicated the thalamus in Parkinson\u2019s disease pathology 76\u201378. We propose that the motor impairment in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants is attributed to loss of the Shh-dependent cTh.Pro1 subtype of thalamic progenitors, resulting in a reduced number of Olig2+ Sox2+ IPCs and subsequently, fewer cTh.N1 thalamic neurons populating motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) during embryonic development.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 MT-CO2 MT-CO1 TMSB4X TUBA1A EEF1A1 PTMA MT-CYTB ACTB HSP90AB1 ACTG1 RPL13 NNAT RPS8 TUBB2B MT-ND4 SOX4 RPS24 RPL41 TPT1 STMN1 RPSA SOX11 MARCKS RPS27A MEG3 MT-ND1 CKB RPS9 H3F3A HSPA8 RPS10 RPLP1 RPL23 RPS14 TUBB5 FAU H3F3B RPL18A TMSB10 FTL1 RPL27A RPS29 RPL8 MT-ND2 RPL32 HSP90AA1 BASP1 RPS3A1 RPL19 MAP1B RPL28 RPL18 RPS15A RPL11 RPS11 RPL37A RPS16 RPS23 RPS26 RPS13 RPL24 RPL30 RPS4X RPS20 RPL6 RPL15 RPS19 RPLP0 EEF2 PPIA RPL9 TTC3 RPL38 RPLP2 RPS5 HNRNPA2B1 FABP7 DDX5 PRDX2 RPL37 RPS3 RPS7 CFL1 RPS12 RACK1 EIF4G2 RPL34 RPL5 RPS15 RPS21 RPL17 RPL14 RPL7 NFIB RPL36 EIF1 RPL21\nCell Type: glutamatergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TUBA1A MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 MT-CO2 STMN1 MT-CO1 ACTG1 TUBB2B TMSB4X EEF1A1 PTMA TUBB5 ACTB SOX11 TCF7L2 NNAT TMSB10 MAP1B BASP1 MT-CYTB TUBB3 HSP90AB1 H3F3A SOX4 TPT1 MEG3 MT-ND4 RPL13 H3F3B RTN1 FTL1 RPS8 RPS24 HSPA8 MARCKS MT-ND1 HSP90AA1 TTC3 PTMS RPL41 GAP43 RPSA STMN2 DPYSL3 RPS14 FAU RPS27A RPS29 MT-ND2 PPIA RPL18A CALM1 RPS9 RPS10 CFL1 RPL23 HNRNPA2B1 EIF4G2 JPT1 RPL27A PRDX2 RPL19 RPLP1 RPL11 EEF2 RPL6 DDX5 RPL8 RPS11 RPL24 ZFHX3 RPS15A RPS16 RPS13 RPL37A RPL32 UCHL1 CELF2 RPS3A1 RPS7 RPS4X RPS23 RPL15 RPS26 RPS15 YWHAE RPL28 ZIC1 EIF1 UBB AUTS2 RPL30 STMN3 RPS20 GNAS RPL18 RPS19 MARCKSL1 RPL17\nCell Type: neural progenitor cell, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO3 MT-ATP6 MT-CO2 TMSB4X TUBA1A MT-CO1 EEF1A1 PTMA ACTG1 RPL13 ACTB RPS8 RPS24 HSP90AB1 TPT1 MT-CYTB RPSA TUBB5 RPL41 TUBB2B RPS27A RPLP1 PTN STMN1 H3F3A RPS10 MT-ND4 FAU H3F3B PPIA RPS9 RPL23 MARCKS RPL8 RPS14 RPS29 FABP7 NNAT HSPA8 HSP90AA1 RPL18A MT-ND1 RPL27A RPL11 RPS20 FTL1 RPS3A1 H2AZ1 RPS4X RPS19 RPS15A RPL19 RPS11 RPS16 SOX11 RPL6 RPL32 RPL37A RPL18 TMSB10 HNRNPA2B1 BASP1 RPS13 RPL15 RPL28 RPS26 RPL30 RPLP0 RPL24 RPL9 MT-ND2 VIM RPS15 RPS23 RPS3 RPS5 CKB RPS12 RPLP2 RPL14 RPS7 RPL17 RPL3 RPL7 HMGB1 RACK1 RPL38 RPS21 RPL5 MAP1B RPL34 RPL37 EIF4G2 RPS2 RPL35A NPM1 RPL21 SOX4 YWHAE\n"}]}}

We propose that the motor impairment in \u0394SBE1/5 mutants is attributed to loss of the Shh-dependent cTh.Pro1 subtype of thalamic progenitors, resulting in a reduced number of Olig2+ Sox2+ IPCs and subsequently, fewer cTh.N1 thalamic neurons populating motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL, VM) during embryonic development.\nDataset: Cell Type: GABAergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO3 ACTB TMSB4X MT-ATP6 ACTG1 EEF1A1 MT-CO1 MT-CO2 TUBA1A RPL41 MARCKS CKB MEG3 FABP7 RPLP1 PTPRZ1 HSP90AB1 PTN PTMA TUBB2B RPS8 RPSA NNAT TPT1 NFIB MT-CYTB RPS24 HSPA8 RPL13 FAU MT-ND4 RPL37A RPS27A QK RPL23 RPL38 RPL8 CPE MT-ND1 H3F3B TCF4 RPS9 DBI HSP90AA1 TTC3 RPS29 HNRNPA2B1 RPS14 RPS10 RPLP2 RPL18A EIF4G2 RPL27A EEF2 BASP1 TMSB10 RPL35A RPL19 RPS20 RTN1 RPS21 RPS26 RPL24 RPS3A1 DDX5 SOX11 FUS RPS15 SCD2 RPS12 RPL30 RPS15A SOX4 RPS19 COX4I1 OLIG1 RPL32 FTL1 SON RPL37 PPIA XIST RPL36 RPL18 RPL28 RPL3 NFIA HNRNPK RPL26 CELF2 RBM39 YWHAE ZBTB20 KCNQ1OT1 TUBB5 RPL5 RPL21 RPL11 CST3\nCell Type: glioblast, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO3 FABP7 ACTB PTN ACTG1 MT-ATP6 EEF1A1 MT-CO2 MT-CO1 TMSB4X RPL41 TUBA1A MARCKS RPS8 PTMA RPLP1 RPS24 RPSA TUBB2B CKB RPL13 TPT1 PTPRZ1 DBI MT-CYTB MEG3 RPS27A HSPA8 RPL37A SCD2 RPL23 MT-ND4 FAU HSP90AB1 QK NNAT RPS29 RPL8 HSP90AA1 RPL27A HNRNPA2B1 NFIB RPL38 RPS10 RPS9 H3F3B RPS15 RPLP2 PPIA RPS14 RPS21 STMN1 RPS20 MT-ND1 TUBB5 CPE EIF4G2 YWHAE RPS12 RPL35A RPL19 RPL18A RPS3A1 RPL24 RPL32 RPS16 TTC3 RPS15A RPL18 RPL30 EEF2 RPS19 FTL1 TMSB10 RPS26 H3F3A HBB-BS SOX11 RPL37 COX4I1 RPL11 RPL6 FUS RPS13 DDX5 BASP1 GNAS RPL3 RPL34 RPS11 RPL36 RPL26 RPS4X TCF4 RPL28 RPL7 SFPQ HNRNPK SON\nCell Type: glutamatergic neuron, Tissue: diencephalon, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TUBA1A MEG3 MT-CO3 ACTG1 TUBB2B MT-ATP6 ACTB MT-CO2 MT-CO1 STMN1 TMSB4X TUBB5 EEF1A1 MAP1B TCF7L2 TMSB10 PTMA RTN1 NNAT SOX11 TUBB3 BASP1 MARCKS MT-CYTB RPL41 TTC3 HSP90AA1 MT-ND4 HSPA8 MT-ND1 STMN2 HSP90AB1 UCHL1 CELF2 RPS24 PTMS RPS8 EIF4G2 NREP DPYSL3 RPLP1 RPSA GAP43 SOX4 TPT1 PPIA SNHG11 RPL38 CRMP1 XIST STMN3 JPT1 H3F3B FNBP1L MAPT NCAM1 HNRNPA2B1 TUBB2A EEF2 FTL1 CALM1 H3F3A RPL13 YWHAE RPS27A FAU DDX5 RPL23 RPS15 GNAS GRIA2 RPS29 MARCKSL1 RPL37A COX4I1 NSG2 HBB-BS ZIC1 GM1673 HMGCS1 RPLP2 DCX DPYSL2 YWHAZ RPS21 CPE RPL8 ELAVL3 RPS9 RPS14 MT-ND2 RPL27A FUS CALM2 NRXN1 MAP2 STMN4 RTN4 SELENOW\n"}]}}

Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

The aetiology of this complex disease is dependent on the interplay of multiple heterogeneous cell types in the pancreatic environment. Here, we provide a single-cell atlas of pancreatic islets of 24 T1D, autoantibody-positive and nondiabetic organ donors across multiple quantitative modalities including 80,000 cells using single-cell transcriptomics, 7,000,000 cells using cytometry by time of flight and 1,000,000 cells using in situ imaging mass cytometry. We develop an advanced integrative analytical strategy to assess pancreatic islets and identify canonical cell types. We show that a subset of exocrine ductal cells acquires a signature of tolerogenic dendritic cells in an apparent attempt at immune suppression in T1D donors. Our multimodal analyses delineate cell types and processes that may contribute to T1D immunopathogenesis and provide an integrative procedure for exploration and discovery of human pancreatic function. Single-cell RNA sequencing unravels novel cell states in the human pancreas To unmask the molecular perturbations occurring in pancreatic tissues during T1D, we constructed 81,313 single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq libraries from pancreatic islets of 24 human organ donors representing three categories: individuals with T1D n  5, those with AAbs towards pancreatic islet proteins but no clinical diagnosis of T1D AAb; n  8 and those with neither AAbs nor a history of T1D control; n  11;, Extended Data,b and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Using three high-throughput single-cell technologies, we provided a comprehensive atlas of millions of cells using integrative multimodal analyses as a molecular microscope to investigate cellular diversity in the pancreas of T1D, AAb and nondiabetic human organ donors.\nDataset: Cell Type: pancreatic D cell, Tissue: islet of Langerhans, Disease: normal, Gene Expression: SST MALAT1 INS MT-CO2

Here, we study the differentiation state and cellular origin of 1300 childhood and adult kidney tumors. Using single cell mRNA reference maps of normal tissues, we quantify reference cellular signals in each tumor. Quantifying global differentiation, we find that childhood tumors exhibit fetal cellular signals, replacing the presumption of fetalness with a quantitative measure of immaturity. By contrast, in adult cancers our assessment refutes the suggestion of dedifferentiation towards a fetal state in most cases. We find an intimate connection between developmental mesenchymal populations and childhood renal tumors. We demonstrate the diagnostic potential of our approach with a case study of a cryptic renal tumor. Our findings provide a cellular definition of human renal tumors through an approach that is broadly applicable to human cancer. An integrated single cell reference map of the kidney The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney and together with its associated vasculature and support cells make up the majority of kidney cells. We have determined normal cell signals in the major types of human renal tumors.\nDataset: Cell Type: epithelial cell of glomerular capsule, Tissue: kidney, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TMSB4X MT-CO1

We have generated dense single-cell and spatial reference maps of the human uterus and three-dimensional endometrial organoid cultures. We dissect the signaling pathways that determine cell fate of the epithelial lineages in the lumenal and glandular microenvironments. Our benchmark of the endometrial organoids reveals the pathways and cell states regulating differentiation of the secretory and ciliated lineages both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro downregulation of WNT or NOTCH pathways increases the differentiation efficiency along the secretory and ciliated lineages, respectively. We utilize our cellular maps to deconvolute bulk data from endometrial cancers and endometriotic lesions, illuminating the cell types dominating in each of these disorders. These mechanistic insights provide a platform for future development of treatments for common conditions including endometriosis and endometrial carcinoma. A single-cell map of the full-thickness human uterus To generate a cellular map of the human endometrium that accounts for the temporal and spatial changes across the menstrual cycle, uterine samples were analyzed by single-cell transcriptomicssingle-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA sequencing snRNA-seqalongside spatial transcriptomics methods 10x Genomics Visium slides and high-resolution microscopy and Extended Data. Profiling the uterus in space and time is essential to define the cell states and signaling pathways of normal human endometrium.\nDataset: Cell Type: ciliated cell, Tissue: uterus, Gene Expression:
