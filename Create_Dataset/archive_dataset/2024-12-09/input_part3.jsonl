To identify and characterize selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex and the superior frontal gyrusbrain regions where neurofibrillary inclusions and neuronal loss occur early and late in AD, respectivelyfrom postmortem brains spanning the progression of AD-type tau neurofibrillary pathology. We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods. We also discovered an astrocyte subpopulation, likely representing reactive astrocytes, characterized by decreased expression of genes involved in homeostatic functions. Our characterization of selectively vulnerable neurons in AD paves the way for future mechanistic studies of selective vulnerability and potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing neuronal resilience.

Here, we investigate the population structure of live microglia purified from human cerebral cortex samples obtained at autopsy and during neurosurgical procedures. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we find that some subsets are enriched for disease-related genes and RNA signatures. We confirm the presence of four of these microglial subpopulations histologically and illustrate the utility of our data by characterizing further microglial cluster 7, enriched for genes depleted in the cortex of individuals with Alzheimers disease AD. Histologically, these cluster 7 microglia are reduced in frequency in AD tissue, and we validate this observation in an independent set of single nucleus data. Thus, our live human microglia identify a range of subtypes, and we prioritize one of these as being altered in AD. Nature and distribution of the single-cell RNA sequencing data The primary goal of this report is to derive a model of microglial population structure with which we can generate and test disease-related hypotheses. details the workflow and the design of this study, which included a discovery dataset of single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq from microglia based on which we define the basic population structure of microglia, in situ confirmation of our findings and independent replication of our observation in two independent datasets, d.: Experimental setup and overview of human samples and datasets used. a Workflow for the generation of the discovery dataset.

Here, we test whether environmental stress can induce cellular dysfunction through modulating RNA-chromatin interactions. We induce endothelial cell EC dysfunction with high glucose and TNF\u03b1 H  T, that mimic the common stress in diabetes mellitus. We characterize the H  T-induced changes in gene expression by single cell scRNA-seq, DNA interactions by Hi-C, and RNA-chromatin interactions by iMARGI. H  T induce inter-chromosomal RNA-chromatin interactions, particularly among the super enhancers. To test the causal relationship between H  T-induced RNA-chromatin interactions and the expression of EC dysfunction-related genes, we suppress the LINC00607 RNA. This suppression attenuates the expression of SERPINE1, a critical pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene. Furthermore, the changes of the co-expression gene network between diabetic and healthy donor-derived ECs corroborate the H  T-induced RNA-chromatin interactions. Taken together, caRNA-mediated dysregulation of gene expression modulates EC dysfunction, a crucial mechanism underlying numerous diseases. High glucose and TNF\u03b1 induce EC dysfunction We first established and characterized an in vitro model of endothelial dysfunction by subjecting human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs to high glucose HG, 25 mM D-glucose and TNF\u03b1 5 ngmL, to mimic inflammation; H  T for 3 and 7 days abbreviated as H  T Days 3 and 7.

When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing with capture-based cell identification on autologous axicabtagene ciloleucel axi-cel anti-CD19 CAR T cell infusion products to identify transcriptomic features associated with efficacy and toxicity in 24 patients with LBCL. Patients who achieved a complete response by positron emission tomographycomputed tomography at their 3-month follow-up had three-fold higher frequencies of CD8 T cells expressing memory signatures than patients with partial response or progressive disease. Molecular response measured by cell-free DNA sequencing at day 7 after infusion was significantly associated with clinical response P  0.008, and a signature of CD8 T cell exhaustion was associated q  2.8  10149 with a poor molecular response. Furthermore, a rare cell population with monocyte-like transcriptional features was associated P  0.0002 with high-grade ICANS. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in the cellular and molecular features of CAR T cell infusion products contributes to variation in efficacy and toxicity after axi-cel therapy in LBCL, and that day 7 molecular response might serve as an early predictor of CAR T cell efficacy. Gene expression signatures of CAR T cell infusion products determined by scRNA-seq and CapID An overview of our approach is shown in. Our results suggest that cellular and molecular diversity of infused CAR T cell products is a major factor contributing to the variability in efficacy and toxicity among patients with LBCL treated with CD19 CAR T cell therapy.\nDataset: Cell Type: CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell, Tissue: blood, Gene Expression: ACTB TMSB10 TMSB4X B2M GAPDH EEF1A1 RPLP1 MT-CO3 RPL10 PTMA MT-CO1 IL32 RPL13 ACTG1

Single-cell RNA sequencing can generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and difficulties in experimental design. Results This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen, esophagus, and lung from  5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison of cell types. We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads, and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples in the spleen, which is cell type specific. Conclusions In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to 24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases the time frames for sample processing. Good scRNA-seq data quality after cold storage We obtained the lung, esophagus, and spleen samples from 12 organ donors Additional file 2: Table S1. We present a method for cold storage of primary human tissue samples that requires no processing at the clinical site beyond sample collection and permits at least a 24-h window for shipping, tissue dissociation, and scRNA-seq.\nDataset: Cell Type: mast cell, Tissue: lung parenchyma, Gene Expression: MALAT1 TPSAB1 TPSB2 FTH1 MT-CO1 TMSB4X MT-ND4 MT-CO2 RPL34 FTL RPLP1 RPL13 MT-ND2 RPS18 RPS14

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

Single-cell RNA sequencing can generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and difficulties in experimental design. Results This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen, esophagus, and lung from  5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison of cell types. We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads, and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples in the spleen, which is cell type specific. Conclusions In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to 24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases the time frames for sample processing. Good scRNA-seq data quality after cold storage We obtained the lung, esophagus, and spleen samples from 12 organ donors Additional file 2: Table S1. We present a method for cold storage of primary human tissue samples that requires no processing at the clinical site beyond sample collection and permits at least a 24-h window for shipping, tissue dissociation, and scRNA-seq.\nDataset: Cell Type: CD8-alpha alpha positive, gamma-delta intraepithelial T cell, Tissue: spleen, Gene Expression: MALAT1 B2M TMSB4X RPS27 RPL13 RPLP2 RPLP1 RPL13A RPS18

The example dataset contains one representative cell from each type and the corresponding cell sentence(ranked gene names by expression). You need to create question-answer pairs for Large Language Models to learn analyzing scRNA-seq datasets when given pieces of data converted into cell sentences. I would like questions and answers about the given cell sentence in terms of cells, tissues, disease, or other relevant biological information. \nThe questions must be answerable by looking at the given cell sentences alone. The question-answer pairs should follow a line of reasoning mentioned in the manuscript or results arrived by the researchers. When creating questions, you should first read the given manuscript, consider what the analysis the researchers did in the manuscript and the biological context of this study. Then look at the example cell sentences(or a part of them), think about what question the researchers asked or would ask about the cell sentence, what they wanted to and can infer, study, or understand. Imitate the interpretation of data in the manuscript. Then answer the question, quote specific cell sentences and genes as evidence, and include a chain of thoughts. You can borrow reasoning and analysis, conclusions from the manuscript but don't directly use or quote the manuscript in question or answer. Avoid questions about experiment design or procedures, avoid vague questions. Try to vary the type of things the question asks and the wording, include both open ended questions and yes or no questions.\nProvide Context for the question, this is only the essential background information required to answer the question. Find context from the manuscript. Provide Answer, including detailed reasonings. Refer to specific cell sentences as [type] cell gene expression. Provide Keywords of the answer being the most essential parts of the correct answer. The keywords should be yes or no(must include if it is a yes or no question), or important gene names, or biological information in question. These keywords will be used during my training to validate my model's response. \nGive 20 question answer pairs as one list, don't give any other word.

Single-cell RNA sequencing can generate high-quality data for the delivery of such an atlas. However, delays between fresh sample collection and processing may lead to poor data and difficulties in experimental design. Results This study assesses the effect of cold storage on fresh healthy spleen, esophagus, and lung from  5 donors over 72 h. We collect 240,000 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with detailed cell type annotations and whole genome sequences of donors, enabling future eQTL studies. Our data provide a valuable resource for the study of these 3 organs and will allow cross-organ comparison of cell types. We see little effect of cold ischemic time on cell yield, total number of reads per cell, and other quality control metrics in any of the tissues within the first 24 h. However, we observe a decrease in the proportions of lung T cells at 72 h, higher percentage of mitochondrial reads, and increased contamination by background ambient RNA reads in the 72-h samples in the spleen, which is cell type specific. Conclusions In conclusion, we present robust protocols for tissue preservation for up to 24 h prior to scRNA-seq analysis. This greatly facilitates the logistics of sample collection for Human Cell Atlas or clinical studies since it increases the time frames for sample processing. Good scRNA-seq data quality after cold storage We obtained the lung, esophagus, and spleen samples from 12 organ donors Additional file 2: Table S1. We present a method for cold storage of primary human tissue samples that requires no processing at the clinical site beyond sample collection and permits at least a 24-h window for shipping, tissue dissociation, and scRNA-seq.\nDataset: Cell Type: B cell, Tissue: epithelium of esophagus, Gene Expression: MALAT1 RPL13A RPLP1 RPS18 TMSB4X RPL13 B2M RPL10 RPLP2 RPS27 RPS12 RPS27A RPL32 RPS14 RPS6

To advance our understanding of the etiology of blinding diseases, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing scRNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of 85,000 cells from the fovea and peripheral retina of seven adult human donors. Utilizing computational methods, we identified 58 cell types within 6 classes: photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and non-neuronal cells. Nearly all types are shared between the two retinal regions, but there are notable differences in gene expression and proportions between foveal and peripheral cohorts of shared types. We then used the human retinal atlas to map expression of 636 genes implicated as causes of or risk factors for blinding diseases. Many are expressed in striking cell class-, type-, or region-specific patterns. Finally, we compared gene expression signatures of cell types between human and the cynomolgus macaque monkey, Macaca fascicularis. We show that over 90 of human types correspond transcriptomically to those previously identified in macaque, and that expression of disease-related genes is largely conserved between the two species. These results validate the use of the macaque for modeling blinding disease, and provide a foundation for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying visual processing. Cell classes in human retina To generate a comprehensive cell atlas of human retina, we obtained eight retinas from seven genetically unrelated human donors with no clinical history of ocular disease Table S1. We used high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq to generate a cell atlas of the adult human retina.\nDataset: Cell Type: retina horizontal cell, Tissue: fovea centralis, Gene Expression: MALAT1 MT-CO1 MT-CO3 MT-ND4 GAPDH MT-ATP6 MT-CYB PVALB CKB MT-CO2 MT-ND2 MT-ND1 MT-ND3 SEPTIN4 PKM PCP4 FTH1 SEPTIN7 HSP90AA1 PTMA RPL21 TPI1 ALDOA UBC RPL3 RPL13A HSP90AB1 FTL CALM2 VAMP2 EIF1 PEBP1 RPLP1 HSPA1A RPL34 NEAT1 EIF4A2 RPL10 RPL15 SOD1 RPS15 EEF1A1 HSPB1 HSPA8 CNTNAP2 RPS27A TUBA1B VDAC1 RPL41 YWHAQ ENO1 LDHA MT-ND5 STMN1 RPS14 RPL13 RPL7 CIRBP RPL32 RPL27A RPS18 SKP1 COX4I1 UBB RPS19 PGK1 TAGLN3 RPS3A TERF2IP H3-3B ATP6V1F HSPA1B CHCHD2 RPL11 ITM2B ALDOC RPS28 RPS27 RPL26 RPLP2 RPS23 RPS12 FAU RPL37A RPS2 RPL23A RPS25 PTN SRP14 ANK2 GABARAPL2 PCSK1N MGARP RPL35A RPL9 CFL1 RPS3 EEF2 COX6C RPL18A\nCell Type: retina horizontal cell, Tissue: peripheral region of retina, Gene Expression: MALAT1 GAPDH MT-CO1 MT-ND4 MT-CO3 HSP90AA1 CKB MT-ATP6 PVALB PKM ENO1 ALDOA MT-CYB TPI1 MT-CO2 MT-ND2 PTMA FTH1 MT-ND1 UBC HSPA1A LDHA HSP90AB1 SEPTIN7 VAMP2 PGK1 MT-ND3 HSPA8 NEAT1 VDAC1 ALDOC SYNPR EIF1 MGARP PEBP1 HSPB1 EEF1A1 BNIP3 RPL21 EIF4A2 RPL13A ACTB FTL CALM2 RPL3 CNTNAP2 CALB1 H3-3B ITM2B RPLP1 RPL15 TERF2IP BTG1 RPS15 RORB UBB PSAP RTN4 CHCHD2 SEPTIN4 RPL41 NDFIP1 ATP1B1 PGAM1 OAZ1 SOD1 GPX3 RPL10 SKP1 RPL34 YWHAQ RPS28 PCSK1N SEC62 RPL13 RPS27A GABARAPL2 ENO2 RPL7 CALM1 CIRBP NDRG4 MORF4L1 MT-ND5 ACTG1 PTN RPS3A CDC42EP4 TAGLN3 RPS14 CFL1 CACNG3 RPL32 RPS27 HNRNPA2B1 RPL37A ZNF593OS RPLP2 LNP1 SPP1\n"}]}}
